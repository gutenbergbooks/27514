<h2>By Way Of Introduction</h2>

<p>
It is not good that a book should be alone: this
is a companion volume to <i>A Bunch of Everlastings</i>.
'O God,' cried Caliban from the abyss,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O God, if you wish for our love,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Fling us <i>a handful of stars</i>!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
The Height evidently accepted the challenge of the
Depth. Heaven hungered for the love of Earth,
and so the stars were thrown. I have gathered up
a few, and, like children with their beads and berries,
have threaded them upon this string. It will
be seen that they do not all belong to the same constellation.
Most of them shed their luster over the
stern realities of life: a few glittered in the firmament
of fiction. It matters little. A great romance
is a portrait of humanity, painted by a master-hand.
When the novelist employs the majestic words of
revelation to transfigure the lives of his characters,
he does so because, in actual experience, he finds
those selfsame words indelibly engraven upon the
souls of men. And, after all, <i>Sydney Carton's Text</i>
is really <i>Charles Dickens' Text</i>; <i>Robinson Crusoe's
Text</i> is <i>Daniel Defoe's Text</i>; the text that stands
embedded in the pathos of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
text that Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe had enthroned
within her heart. Moreover, to whatever group
these splendid orbs belong, their deathless radiance
has been derived, in every case, from the perennial
Fountain of all Beauty and Brightness.

<h3>WILLIAM PENN'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
The Algonquin chiefs are gathered in solemn
conclave. They make a wild and striking and picturesque
group. They are assembled under the
wide-spreading branches of a giant elm, not far
from the banks of the Delaware. It is easy to see
that something altogether unusual is afoot. Ranging
themselves in the form of a crescent, these men
of scarred limbs and fierce visage fasten their eyes
curiously upon a white man who, standing against
the bole of the elm, comes to them as white man
never came before. He is a young man of about
eight and thirty, wearing about his lithe and well-knit
figure a sash of skyblue silk. He is tall, handsome
and of commanding presence. His movements
are easy, agile and athletic; his manner is
courtly, graceful and pleasing; his voice, whilst
deep and firm, is soft and agreeable; his face inspires
instant confidence. He has large lustrous eyes
which seem to corroborate and confirm every word
that falls from his lips. These tattooed warriors
read him through and through, as they have trained
themselves to do, and they feel that they can trust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
him. In his hand he holds a roll of parchment. For
this young man in the skyblue sash is William Penn.
He is making his famous treaty with the Indians.
It is one of the most remarkable instruments ever
completed. 'It is the only treaty,' Voltaire declares,
'that was ever made without an oath, and the only
treaty that never was broken.' By means of this
treaty with the Indians, William Penn is beginning
to realize the greatest aspiration of his life. For
William Penn has set his heart on being the Conqueror
of the World!
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Strangely enough, it was a Quaker who fired the
young man's fancy with this proud ambition.
Thomas Loe was William Penn's good angel.
There seemed to be no reason why their paths
should cross, yet their paths were always crossing.
A subtle and inexplicable magnetism drew them together.
Penn's father--Sir William Penn--was an
admiral, owning an estate in Ireland. When William
was but a small boy, Thomas Loe visited Cork.
The coming of the Quaker caused a mild sensation;
nobody knew what to make of it. Moved largely
by curiosity, the admiral invited the quaint preacher
to visit him. He did so, and, before leaving, addressed
the assembled household. William was too
young to understand, but he was startled when, in
the midst of the address, a colored servant wept
aloud. The boy turned in his astonishment to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
father, only to notice that tears were making their
way down the bronzed cheeks of the admiral. The
incident filled him with wonder and perplexity. He
never forgot it. It left upon his mind an indelible
impression of the intense reality of all things spiritual.
As a schoolboy, he would wander in the forests
that so richly surrounded his Essex home, and
give himself to rapt and silent contemplation. On
one occasion, he tells us, he 'was suddenly surprised
with an inward comfort.' It seemed to him
as if a heavenly glory irradiated the room in which
he was sitting. He felt that he could never afterwards
doubt the existence of God nor question
the possibility of the soul's access to Him.
</p>

<p>
It was at Oxford that the boy's path crossed that
of the Quaker for the <i>second</i> time. When, as a lad
of sixteen, William Penn went up to the University,
he found to his surprise that Oxford was the
home of Thomas Loe. There the good man had
already suffered imprisonment for conscience sake.
The personality of the Quaker appealed to the reflective
temperament of the young student, whilst
the good man's sufferings for his convictions awoke
his profoundest sympathies. To the horror of his
father, he ardently espoused the persecuted cause,
involving himself in such disfavor with the authorities
of the University that they peremptorily
ordered his dismissal.
</p>

<p>
But it was the third crossing of the paths that
most deeply and permanently affected the destinies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of William Penn. Soon after his expulsion from
Oxford, he was appointed Victualler of the Squadron
lying off Kinsale, and was authorized to reside
at, and manage, his father's Irish estate. It was
whilst he was thus engaged that Thomas Loe re-visited
Cork. Penn, of course, attended the meetings.
'It was in this way,' he tells us, 'that God,
in His everlasting kindness, guided my feet in the
flower of my youth, when about two and twenty
years of age. He visited me with a certain testimony
of His eternal Word through a Quaker named
Thomas Loe.' The text at that memorable and historic
service, like a nail in a sure place, fastened
itself upon the mind of the young officer. Thomas
Loe preached from the words: '<i>This is the victory
that overcometh the world, even our faith.</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>The faith that overcomes!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The faith by which a man may conquer the world!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The faith that is itself a victory!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith!'</i>
</p>

<p>
Penn was electrified. His whole being was
stirred to its depths. 'The undying fires of enthusiasm
at once blazed up within him,' one record
declares. 'He was exceedingly reached and wept
much,' the Quaker chronicle assures us. He renounced
every hope that he had ever cherished in
order that he might realize this one. This was in
1666--the year in which London was devoured by
the flames.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>
'Penn's conversion,' says Dr. Stoughton, 'was
now completed. That conversion must not be regarded
simply as a change of opinion. It penetrated
his moral nature. It made him a new man.
He rose into another sphere of spiritual life and
consciousness.'
</p>

<p>
In his lecture on <i>Evangelist</i>, Dr. Alexander
Whyte says that the first minister whose words
were truly blessed of God for our awakening and
conversion has always a place of his own in our
hearts. Thomas Loe certainly had a place peculiarly
his own in the heart of William Penn. Penn
was with him at the last.
</p>

<p>
'Stand true to God!' cried the dying Quaker,
as he clasped the hand of his most notable convert.
'Stand faithful for God! There is no other way!
This is the way in which the holy men of old all
walked. Walk in it and thou shalt prosper! Live
for God and He will be with you! I can say no
more. The love of God overcomes my heart!'
</p>

<p>
<i>The love that overcomes!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The faith that overcomes!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith!</i>'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
William Penn realized his dream. He became
the Conqueror of the World. Indeed, he conquered
not one world, but two. Or perhaps, after all, they
were merely two hemispheres of the selfsame world.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
One was the World <i>Within</i>; the other was the
World <i>Without</i>; and, of the two, the <i>first</i> is always
the harder to conquer.
</p>

<p>
The victory that overcometh <i>the world</i>! What
is <i>the world</i>? The Puritans talked much about <i>the
world</i>; and Penn was the contemporary of the
Puritans. Cromwell died just as the admiral was preparing
to send his son to Oxford. Whilst at Cork,
Penn sat listening to Thomas Loe's sermon on <i>the
faith that overcometh the world</i>, John Milton was
putting the finishing touches to <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and
John Bunyan was languishing in Bedford Gaol.
Each of the three had something to say about <i>the
world</i>. To Cromwell it was, as he told his daughter,
'whatever cooleth thine affection after Christ.'
Bunyan gave his definition of <i>the world</i> in his picture
of Vanity Fair. Milton likened <i>the world</i> to
an obscuring mist--a fog that renders dim and indistinct
the great realities and vitalities of life. It
is an atmosphere that chills the finest delicacies and
sensibilities of the soul. It is too subtle and too
elusive to be judged by external appearances. In
his fine treatment of <i>the world</i>, Bishop Alexander
cites, by way of illustration, still another of the
contemporaries of William Penn. He paints a pair
of companion pictures. He depicts a gay scene at
the frivolous and dissolute Court of Charles the
Second; and, beside it, he describes a religious assembly
of the same period. The <i>first</i> gathering appears
to be altogether worldly: the <i>second</i> has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
nothing of <i>the world</i> about it. Yet, he says, Mary
Godolphin lived her life at Court without being
tainted by any shadow of worldliness, whilst many
a man went up to those solemn assemblies with <i>the
world</i> raging furiously within his soul!
</p>

<p>
William Penn saw <i>the world</i> in his heart that
day as he listened to Thomas Loe; and, in order
that he might overcome it, he embraced the faith
that the Quaker proclaimed. '<i>This is the victory
that overcometh the world, even our faith.</i>' And
by that faith he overcame <i>the world</i>. Many years
afterwards he himself told the story.
</p>

<p>
'The Lord first appeared to me,' he says, in his
<i>Journal</i>, 'in the twelfth year of my age, and He
visited me at intervals afterwards and gave me divine
impressions of Himself. He sustained me
through the darkness and debauchery of Oxford,
through all my experiences in France, through the
trials that arose from my father's harshness, and
through the terrors of the Great Plague. He gave
me a deep sense of the vanity of the world and of
the irreligiousness of the religions of it. The glory
of the world often overtook me, and I was ever
ready to give myself up to it.' But, invariably, <i>the
faith that overcometh the world</i> proved victorious.
In his monumental <i>History of the United States</i>,
Bancroft says that, splendid as were the triumphs
of Penn, his greatest conquest was the conquest of
his own soul. Extraordinary as was the greatness
of his mind; remarkable, both for universality and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
precision, as were the vast conceptions of his genius;
profound as was his scholarship, and astute as was
his diplomacy; the historian is convinced that, in
the last resort, his greatest contribution to history
is the development and influence of his impressive
and robust character. 'He was prepared for his
work,' Bancroft says, 'by the severe discipline of
life; and love without dissimulation formed the
basis of his being. The sentiment of cheerful humanity
was irrepressibly strong in his bosom;
benevolence gushed prodigally from his ever overflowing
heart; and when, in his late old age, his intellect
was impaired and his reason prostrated, his
sweetness of disposition rose serenely over the
clouds of disease.' The winsomeness of his ways
and the courtliness of his bearing survived for many
months the collapse of his memory and the loss of
his powers of speech.
</p>

<p>
Such was his faith's <i>first</i> victory. It was the
conquest of the world <i>within</i>.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
'<i>This is the victory that overcometh the world,
even our faith.</i>' It was by his faith that he obtained
his <i>second</i> great triumph--his conquest of
the world <i>without</i>. He disarmed nations by confiding
in them. He bound men to himself by trusting
them. He vanquished men by believing in
them. It was always by his faith that he overcame.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>
When the admiral died, the nation was in his
debt to the extent of sixteen thousand pounds. This
amount--on its recovery--Sir William bequeathed
to his son. In due time the matter was compounded,
William Penn agreeing to accept an immense belt of
virgin forest in North America in full settlement of
his claim. He resolved to establish a new colony
across the seas under happier conditions than any
State had ever known. It should be called Pennsylvania;
it should be the land of freedom; its capital
should be named Philadelphia--the City of Brotherly
Love. He was reminded that his first task
would be to subdue the Indians. The savages,
everybody said, must be conquered; and William
Penn made up his mind to conquer them; but he
determined to conquer them in his own way. '<i>This
is the victory that overcometh the world, even our
faith.</i>' The Indians were accustomed to slaughter.
They understood no language but the language of
the tomahawk and the scalping-knife. Ever since
the white man had landed on American shores, the
forests had resounded with the war-whoops of the
tribesmen. One night a colonial settlement had been
raided by the red men: the next an Indian village
had been burned, and its inhabitants massacred by
the outraged whites. The Indians looked with
hatred upon the smoke of the English settlements;
the settlers dreaded the forests which protected the
ambush, and secured the retreat of their murderous
foes. William Penn conquered the Indians, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
conquered them--according to his text--<i>by his
faith</i>. 'He will always be mentioned with honor,'
Macaulay says, 'as a founder of a colony who did
not, in his dealings with a savage people, abuse the
strength derived from civilization, and as a lawgiver
who, in an age of persecution, made religious liberty
the cornerstone of his policy.'
</p>

<p>
Immediately upon his arrival he called the Indians
to meet him. They gathered under the great
elm at Shakamaxon--a spot that is now marked
by a monument. He approached the chiefs unarmed;
and they, in return, threw away their bows
and arrows. Presents were exchanged and speeches
made. Penn told the natives that he desired nothing
but their friendship. He undertook that neither he
nor any of his friends should ever do the slightest
injury to the person or the property of an Indian;
and they, in reply, bound themselves 'to live in love
with Onas'--as they called him--'and with the children
of Onas, as long as the sun and the moon shall
endure.' 'This treaty of peace and friendship was
made,' as Bancroft says, 'under the open sky, by the
side of the Delaware, with the sun and the river and
the forest for witnesses. It was not confirmed by
an oath; it was not ratified by signatures and seals;
no written record of the conference can be found;
and its terms and conditions had no abiding monument,
but on the heart. <i>There</i> they were written
like the law of God and were never forgotten. The
simple sons of the wilderness, returning to their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wigwams, kept the history of the covenant by strings
of wampum, and, long afterwards, in their cabins,
they would count over the shells on a clean piece of
bark and recall to their own memory, and repeat to
their children or to the stranger, the words of William
Penn.' The world laughed at the fantastic
agreement; but the world noticed, at the same time,
that, whilst the neighboring colonies were being
drenched in blood and decimated by the barbarity
of the Mohicans and the Delawares, the hearths of
Pennsylvania enjoyed an undisturbed repose. No
drop of Quaker blood was ever shed by an Indian.
So complete was the victory of the faith of William
Penn!
</p>

<p>
Nor was the conquest merely negative. When,
after a few years, the Quakers began to swarm
across the Atlantic to people the new settlement,
they were confronted by experiences such as await
all pioneers, in young colonies. There were times
of stress and privation and hardship. The stern
voice of necessity commanded even delicate women
to undertake tasks for which their frames were far
too frail. In that emergency the Indians came to
the rescue. The red men worked for them, trapped
for them, hunted for them, and served them in a
thousand ways. 'You are all the children of Onas!'
they said. Nothing delighted the Indians more
than to receive the great Onas as their guest. A
feast was arranged in the depths of the forest, bucks
were killed, cakes were cooked, and the whole tribe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
abandoned itself to festivity and rejoicing. And
when, years afterwards, they heard that Onas was
dead, they sent his widow a characteristic message
of sympathy, accompanied by a present of beautiful
furs. 'These skins,' they said, 'are to protect you
whilst passing through the thorny wilderness without
your guide.' The story of the founding of
Pennsylvania is, as a classical writer finely says,
'one of the most beautiful incidents in the history
of the age.' It was the victory of faith--<i>the faith
that overcometh the world</i>!

'His character always triumphed,' says Bancroft.
'His name was fondly cherished as a household
word in the cottages of the old world; and not a
tenant of a wigwam from the Susquehannah to the
sea doubted his integrity. His fame is as wide as
the world: he is one of the few who have gained
abiding glory.'

<h3>ROBINSON CRUSOE'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
During the years that Robinson Crusoe spent
upon the island, his most distinguished visitor was
a text. Three times it came knocking at the door
of his hut, and at the door of his heart. It came
to him as his <i>doctor</i> in the day of sore sickness; it
came as his <i>minister</i> when his soul was in darkness
and distress; and it came as his <i>deliverer</i> in the hour
of his most extreme peril.
</p>

<p>
Nine months after the shipwreck Crusoe was
overtaken by a violent fever. His situation filled
him with alarm, for he had no one to advise him,
no one to help him, no one to care whether he lived
or died. The prospect of death filled him with ungovernable
terror.

'Suddenly,' he says, 'it occurred to my thought
that the Brazilians take no physic but tobacco for
all their distempers, and I remembered that I had a
roll of tobacco in one of the chests that I had saved
from the wreck. I went, directed by heaven no
doubt; for in this chest I found a cure both for soul
and body. I opened the chest and found the tobacco
that I was looking for; and I also found a Bible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
which, up to this time, I had found neither leisure
nor inclination to look into. I took up the Bible
and began to read. Having opened the book casually,
the first words that occurred to me were these:
"<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.</i>" The words
were very apt to my case. They made a great impression
upon me and I mused upon them very
often. I left my lamp burning in the cave lest I
should want anything in the night, and went to bed.
But before I lay down I did what I never had done
in all my life--I kneeled down and prayed. I asked
God to fulfil the promise to me that if I called upon
Him in the day of trouble He would deliver me.'
</p>

<p>
Those who have been similarly situated know
what such prayers are worth. 'When the devil was
sick the devil a saint would be.' Crusoe's prayer
was the child of his terror. He was prepared to
snatch at anything which might stand between him
and a lonely death. When he called for deliverance,
he meant deliverance from sickness and solitude;
but it was not of <i>that</i> deliverance that the text had
come to speak. When, therefore, the crisis had
passed, the text repeated its visit. It came to him
in time of health.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' says Crusoe, 'I began to construe the
words that I had read--"<i>Call upon Me in the day
of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify Me</i>"--in a different sense from what I had
done before. For then I had no notion of any deliverance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
but my deliverance from the captivity
I was in. But now I learned to take it in another
sense. Now I looked back upon my past life with
such horror, and my sins appeared so dreadful,
that my soul sought nothing of God but deliverance
from the load of guilt that bore down all my comfort.
As for my lonely life, it was nothing. I did
not so much as pray for deliverance from my solitude;
it was of no consideration in comparison with
deliverance from my sin.'
</p>

<p>
This <i>second</i> visit of the text brought him, Crusoe
tells us, a great deal of comfort. So did the third.
That <i>third</i> memorable visit was paid eleven years
later. Everybody remembers the stirring story. 'It
happened one day, about noon,' Crusoe says. 'I
was exceedingly surprised, on going towards my
boat, to see the print of a man's naked foot on the
shore. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I
had seen a ghost. I examined it again and again to
make sure that it was not my fancy; and then, confused
with terror, I fled, like one pursued, to my
fortification, scarcely feeling the ground I trod on,
looking behind me at every two or three steps, and
fancying every stump to be a man.' It was on his
arrival at his fortification that the text came to him
the third time.
</p>

<p>
'Lying in my bed,' he says, 'filled with thoughts
of my danger from the appearance of savages, my
mind was greatly discomposed. Then, suddenly,
these words of Scripture came into my thoughts:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
"<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.</i>" Upon this,
rising cheerfully out of my bed, I was guided and
encouraged to pray earnestly to God for deliverance.
It is impossible to express the comfort this gave me.
In answer, I thankfully laid down the Book and was
no more sad.'
</p>

<p>
These, then, were the three visits that the text
paid to Crusoe on his desolate island. '<i>Call upon
Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify Me.</i>'
</p>

<p>
When the text came to him the <i>first</i> time, he
called for deliverance from <i>sickness</i>; and was in a
few days well.
</p>

<p>
When the text came to him the <i>second</i> time, he
called for deliverance from <i>sin</i>; and was led to a
crucified and exalted Saviour.
</p>

<p>
When the text came to him the <i>third</i> time, he
called for deliverance from <i>savages</i>; and the savages,
so far from hurting a hair of his head, furnished
him with his man Friday, the staunchest,
truest friend he ever had.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Call upon Me</i>,' said the text, not once, nor twice,
but thrice. And, three times over, Crusoe called,
and each time was greatly and wonderfully delivered.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was written in 1719; exactly a
century later <i>The Monastery</i> was published. And,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
significantly enough, the text which shines with such
luster in Daniel Defoe's masterpiece forms also the
pivot of Sir Walter Scott's weird story. Mary
Avenel comes to the climax of her sorrows. She
seems to have lost everything and everybody. Her
life is desolate; her grief is inconsolable. Her
faithful attendant, Tibbie, exhausts herself in futile
attempts to compose and comfort the mind of her
young mistress. Father Eustace does his best to
console her; but she feels that it is all words, words,
words. All at once, however, she comes upon her
mother's Bible--the Bible that had passed through
so many strange experiences and had been so wonderfully
preserved. Remembering that this little
Book was her mother's constant stay and solace--her
counselor in time of perplexity and her comfort
in the hour of grief--Mary seized it, Sir Walter
says, with as much joy as her melancholy situation
permitted her to feel. Ignorant as she was of its
contents, she had nevertheless learned from infancy
to hold the Volume in sacred veneration. On opening
it, she found that, among the leaves, there were
texts neatly inscribed in her mother's handwriting.
In Mary's present state of mind, these passages,
reaching her at a time so critical and in a manner
so touching, strangely affected her. She read on
one of these slips the consoling exhortation: '<i>Call
upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.</i>' 'There are those,'
Sir Walter says, 'to whom a sense of religion has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
come in storm and tempest; there are those whom
it has summoned amid scenes of revelry and idle
vanity; there are those, too, who have heard its
still small voice amid rural leisure and placid contentment.
But perhaps the knowledge which causeth
not to err is most frequently impressed upon
the mind during seasons of affliction; and tears are
the softened showers which cause the seed of
heaven to spring and take root in the human breast.
At least, it was thus with Mary Avenel. She read
the words--"<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me</i>"--and
her heart acquiesced in the conclusion: Surely
this is the Word of God!'
</p>

<p>
In the case of Mary Avenel, the resultant deliverance
was as dramatic as in the case of Robinson
Crusoe. I turn a few pages of <i>The Monastery</i>, and
I come upon this:
</p>

<p>
'The joyful news that Halbert Glendinning--Mary's
lover--still lived was quickly communicated
through the sorrowing family. His mother wept
and thanked heaven alternately. On Mary Avenel
the impression was inconceivably deeper. She had
newly learned to pray, and it seemed to her that her
prayers had been instantly answered. She felt that
the compassion of heaven, which she had learned to
implore in the very words of Scripture--"<i>Call upon
Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify Me</i>"--had descended upon
her after a manner almost miraculous, and recalled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the dead from the grave at the sound of her lamentations.'
</p>

<p>
I lay <i>this</i>, written by Sir Walter Scott, in 1819,
beside <i>that</i>, written by Daniel Defoe in 1719. In
the mouths of two such witnesses shall every word
be established.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
What was it that led both Daniel Defoe and Sir
Walter Scott to give the text such prominence?
What was it in the text that appealed so irresistibly
to Robinson Crusoe and to Mary Avenel? The
answer is fourfold.
</p>

<p>
1. It was the <i>Charm of Companionship</i>. Robinson
Crusoe fancied that he was alone upon his
island. Mary Avenel fancied that she was left
friendless and forsaken. They were both mistaken;
and it was the text that showed them their mistake.
'<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee.</i>' If such a Deliverer is at hand--so near
as to be within sound of their voices--how can Robinson
Crusoe be solitary or Mary Avenel forsaken?
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Speak to Him, thou, for He hears; spirit with spirit can meet--<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Closer is He than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
If there be a shadow of truth in Robinson Crusoe's
text, there is no such thing as loneliness for
any of us!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>
2. It was the <i>Ring of Certainty</i>. There is a
strange and holy dogmatism about the great evangelical
promises. '<i>Call and I will deliver.</i>' Other
physicians say: 'I will come and do my best.' The
Great Physician says: 'I will come and heal him.'
<i>The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that
which is lost.</i> He did not embark upon a magnificent
effort; He came to do it.
</p>

<p>
3. It was the <i>Claim of Monopoly</i>. 'Call upon
<i>Me</i> in the day of trouble, and <i>I</i> will deliver thee.'
It suggests the utter absence of alternatives, of selection,
of picking and choosing. In the straits of
the soul, the issues are wonderfully simple. There
is none other Name given under heaven among men
whereby we must be saved. It is <i>this</i> Companion--or
solitude; <i>this</i> Deliverer--or captivity; <i>this</i>
Saviour--or none.
</p>

<p>
4. It was the <i>Absence of Technicality</i>. '<i>Call!</i>'--that
is all. '<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble,
and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me!</i>'
<i>Call!</i>--as a little child calls for his mother. <i>Call!</i>--as
a drowning man calls for help. <i>Call!</i>--as a
frenzied woman calls wildly for succor. There are
great emergencies in which we do not fastidiously
choose our words. It is not the mind but the heart
that, at such moments, gives to the tongue its noblest
eloquence. The prayer that moves Omnipotence
to pity, and summons all the hosts of heaven
to help, is not the prayer of nicely rounded periods--Faultily
faultless, icily regular, splendidly null--but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the prayer of passionate entreaty. It is a <i>call</i>--a
call such as a doctor receives at dead of night; a
call such as the fireman receives when all the alarms
are clanging; a call such as the ships receive in
mid-ocean, when, hurtling through the darkness and
the void, there comes the wireless message, 'S.O.S.'
'<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.</i>' Had the text
demanded a tinge of technicality it would have been
useless to Robinson Crusoe; it would have mocked
the simple soul of poor Mary Avenel. But a call!
Robinson Crusoe can call! Mary Avenel can call!
Anybody can call! Wherefore, '<i>call</i>,' says the text,
'<i>just call, and He will deliver</i>!'
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
But I need not have resorted to fiction for a testimony
to the value and efficacy of the text--striking
and significant as that testimony is. I need have
summoned neither Daniel Defoe nor Sir Walter
Scott. I could have dispensed with both Robinson
Crusoe and Mary Avenel. I could have called a
King and Queen to bear all the witness that I
wanted.
</p>

<p>
King Edward the Seventh!
</p>

<p>
And Queen Alexandra!
</p>

<p>
For Robinson Crusoe's text is King Edward's
text; and Mary Avenel's text is Queen Alexandra's
text. There are men and women still living who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
remember those dark and dreadful days of December,
1871, when it seemed as if the life of King
Edward--then Prince of Wales--hung by a single
thread. Nobody thought of anything else; the
whole world seemed to surround that royal sickbed;
the Empire was in a state of breathless suspense.
Sunday, the tenth of December, was set aside as
a Day of Solemn Intercession, and the strained intensity
of the public anxiety reflected itself in
crowded but hushed congregations.
</p>

<p>
And what was going on at the inner heart of
things? Early that Sunday morning, the Princess--afterwards
Queen Alexandra--opened her Bible
and was greeted with these words: '<i>Call upon Me
in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and
thou shalt glorify Me.</i>' A little later, just as the
Vicar of Sandringham, the Rev. W. L. Onslow,
was preparing to enter his pulpit, he received a
note from the Princess. 'My husband being, thank
God, somewhat better,' she wrote, 'I am coming to
church. I must leave, I fear, before the service is
concluded, that I may watch by his bedside. Can
you not say a few words in prayer in the early part
of the service, that I may join with you in prayer
for my husband before I return to him?' The congregation
was deeply affected when the Princess
appeared, and the rector, with trembling voice, said:
'The prayers of the congregation are earnestly
sought for His Royal Highness, the Prince of
Wales, who is now most seriously ill.' This was on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
December the tenth. For the next few days the
Prince hovered between life and death. The crisis
came on the fourteenth, which, ominously enough,
was the anniversary of the death of the Prince Consort.
But, whilst the superstitious shook their
heads, the Princess clung desperately and believingly
to the hope that the text had brought her. And that
day, in a way that was almost dramatic, the change
came. Sir William Gull, the royal physician, had
done all that the highest human skill could suggest;
he felt that the issue was now in other hands than
his. He was taking a short walk up and down the
terrace, when one of the nurses came running to
him with pallid face and startled eyes. 'Oh, come,
Sir William,' she said, 'there is a change; the Prince
is worse!' And, as doctor and nurse hurried together
to the sick room, she added bitterly, 'I do
not believe God answers prayer! Here is all England
praying that he may recover, and he's going to
die!' But Sir William Gull's first glance at the
Royal patient showed him that the change was for
the better. From that moment there was a sure
hope of the Prince's recovery, and, by Christmas
Day, he was out of danger. Later on, when her
husband's restoration was complete, the Princess
raised a monument to the deliverance that she had
experienced. She presented to the Sandringham
Church a brass lectern bearing this inscription:
'To the glory of God; a thank offering for His
mercy; 14th December, 1871.--Alexandra. <i>When</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<i>I was in trouble I called upon the Lord, and He
heard me.</i>'
</p>

<p>
Nor is that quite the end of the story. Thirty
years later, the Prince ascended the throne. He
was to have been crowned on June 26, 1902; but
again he was stricken down by serious illness. He
recovered, however, and the Coronation took place
on the ninth of August. Those familiar with the
Coronation Service noticed a striking innovation.
The words: '<i>When I was in trouble, I called upon
the Lord, and He heard me</i>,' were introduced into
one of the prayers. 'The words,' Archdeacon Wilberforce
afterwards explained, 'were written by the
King's own hand, and were used by the Archbishop
at His Majesty's express command.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will
deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me</i>,' says the
text.
</p>

<p>
'<i>When I was in trouble, I called upon the Lord,
and He heard me</i>,' said King Edward and Queen
Alexandra.
</p>

<p>
'I was in trouble through my <i>sickness</i>, and in
trouble through my <i>sin</i>,' said Robinson Crusoe, 'and
when I called upon the Lord, He heard and delivered me.'
</p>

<p>
So true is it that <i>whosoever shall call on the Name
of the Lord, the same shall be saved</i>.

<h3>JAMES CHALMERS' TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
He was 'a broth of a boy,' his biographer tells
us. He lived chiefly on boots and boxes. Eager to
know what lay beyond the ranges, he wore out more
boots than his poor parents found it easy to provide.
Taunted by the constant vision of the restless
waters, he put out to sea in broken boxes and
leaky barrels, that he might follow in the wake of
the great navigators. He was a born adventurer.
Almost as soon as he first opened his eyes and
looked around him, he felt that the world was very
wide and vowed that he would find its utmost edges.
From his explorations of the hills and glens around
his village home, he often returned too exhausted
either to eat or sleep. From his ventures upon the
ocean he was more than once brought home on a
plank, apparently drowned. 'The wind and the sea
were his playmates,' we are told; 'he was as much at
home in the water as on the land; in fishing, sailing,
climbing over the rocks, and wandering among the
silent hills, he spent a free, careless, happy boyhood.'
Every day had its own romance, its hairbreadth
escape, its thrilling adventure.
</p>

<p>
Therein lies the difference between a man and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
beast. At just about the time at which James
Chalmers was born in Scotland, Captain Sturt led
his famous expedition into the hot and dusty heart
of Australia. When he reached Cooper's Creek on
the return journey, he found that he had more
horses than he would be able to feed; so he turned
one of them out on the banks of the creek and left
it there. When Burke and Wills reached Cooper's
Creek twenty years later, the horse was still grazing
peacefully on the side of the stream, and looked
up at the explorers with no more surprise or excitement
than it would have shown if but twenty hours
had passed since it last saw human faces. It had
found air to breathe and water to drink and grass
to nibble; what did it care about the world? But
with man it is otherwise. He wants to know what
is on the other side of the hill, what is on the other
side of the water, what is on the other side of the
world! If he cannot go North, South, East and
West himself, he must at least have his newspaper;
and the newspaper brings all the ends of the earth
every morning to his doorstep and his breakfast-table.
This, I say, is the difference between a beast
and a man; and James Chalmers--known in New
Guinea as the most magnificent specimen of humanity
on the islands--was every inch <i>a man</i>.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
But his text! What was James Chalmers' text?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
When he was eighteen years of age, Scotland found
herself in the throes of a great religious revival.
In the sweep of this historic movement, a couple
of evangelists from the North of Ireland announce
that they will conduct a series of evangelistic meetings
at Inverary. But Chalmers and a band of
daring young spirits under his leadership feel that
this is an innovation which they must strenuously
resist. They agree to break up the meetings. A
friend, however, with much difficulty persuades
Chalmers to attend the first meeting and judge for
himself whether or not his project is a worthy
one.
</p>

<p>
'It was raining hard,' he says, in some autobiographical
notes found among his treasures after the
massacre, 'it was raining hard, but I started; and on
arriving at the bottom of the stairs I listened whilst
they sang "All people that on earth do dwell" to the
tune "Old Hundred," and I thought I had never
heard such singing before--so solemn, yet so joyful.
I ascended the steps and entered. There was a large
congregation and all intensely in earnest. The
younger of the evangelists was the first to speak.
He announced as his text the words: "<i>The Spirit
and the Bride say, Come; and let him that heareth
say, Come; and let him that is athirst come; and
whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</i>"
He spoke directly to me. I felt it much; but at the
close I hurried away back to town. I returned the
Bible to the friend who, having persuaded me to go,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
had lent it to me, but I was too upset to speak much
to him.'
</p>

<p>
On the following Sunday night, he was,
he says, 'pierced through and through, and felt lost
beyond all hope of salvation.' On the Monday, the
local minister, the Rev. Gilbert Meikle, who had
exercised a deep influence over his early childhood,
came to see him and assured him that the blood of
Jesus Christ, God's Son, could cleanse him from all
sin. This timely visit convinced him that deliverance
was at any rate possible. Gradually he came
to feel that the voices to which he was listening
were, in reality, the Voice of God. 'Then,' he says,
'I believed unto salvation.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>He felt that the voices to which he was listening
were, in reality, the Voice of God.</i>' That is precisely
what the text says. '<i>The Spirit and the Bride
say, Come.</i>' The Bride only says '<i>Come</i>' because
the Spirit says '<i>Come</i>'; the Church only says '<i>Come</i>'
because her Lord says '<i>Come</i>'; the evangelists only
said '<i>Come</i>' because the Voice Divine said '<i>Come</i>.'
'He felt that the voices to which he was listening
were, in reality, the Voice of God, and he believed
unto salvation.'
</p>

<p>
<i>The Spirit said, Come!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The Bride said, Come!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Let him that is athirst come!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>I was athirst,</i>' says Chalmers, '<i>and I came!</i>'
</p>

<p>
And thus a great text began, in a great soul, the
manufacture of a great history.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Forty years later a thrill of horror electrified the
world when the cables flashed from land to land
the terrible tidings that James Chalmers, the most
picturesque and romantic figure in the religious life
of his time, had been killed and eaten by the Fly
River cannibals. It is the evening of Easter Sunday.
It has for years been the dream of his life to
navigate the Fly River and evangelize the villages
along its banks. And now he is actually doing it
at last. 'He is away up the Fly River,' wrote Robert
Louis Stevenson. 'It is a desperate venture,
but he is quite a Livingstone card!' Stevenson
thought Chalmers all gold. 'He is a rowdy, but he
is a hero. You can't weary me of that fellow. He
is as big as a house and far bigger than any church.
He took me fairly by storm for the most attractive,
simple, brave and interesting man in the whole Pacific.'
'I wonder,' Stevenson wrote to Mrs.
Chalmers, 'I wonder if even <i>you</i> know what it
means to a man like <i>me</i>--a man fairly critical, a
man of the world--to meet one who represents the
essential, and who is so free from the formal, from
the grimace.' But I digress. As Stevenson says,
Mr. Chalmers is away up the Fly River, a desperate
venture! But he is boisterously happy about it, and
at sunset on this Easter Sunday evening they anchor
off a populous settlement just round a bend of the
river. The natives, coming off in their canoes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
swarm onto the vessel. With some difficulty, Mr.
Chalmers persuades them to leave the ship, promising
them that he will himself visit them at daybreak.
The savages, bent on treachery and slaughter, pull
ashore and quickly dispatch runners with messages
to all the villages around. When, early next morning,
Mr. Chalmers lands, he is surprised at finding
a vast assemblage gathered to receive him. He is
accompanied by Mr. Tomkins--his young colleague,
not long out from England--and by a party of ten
native Christians. They are told that a great feast
has been prepared in their honor, and they are led
to a large native house to partake of it. But, as he
enters, Mr. Chalmers is felled from behind with a
stone club, stabbed with a cassowary dagger, and
instantly beheaded. Mr. Tomkins and the native
Christians are similarly massacred. The villages
around are soon the scenes of horrible cannibal
orgies. 'I cannot believe it!' exclaimed Dr. Parker
from the pulpit of the City Temple, on the day on
which the tragic news reached England, 'I cannot
believe it! I do not want to believe it! Such a mystery
of Providence makes it hard for our strained
faith to recover itself. Yet Jesus was murdered.
Paul was murdered. Many missionaries have been
murdered. When I think of <i>that</i> side of the case, I
cannot but feel that our honored and noble-minded
friend has joined a great assembly. James Chalmers
was one of the truly great missionaries of the world.
He was, in all respects, a noble and kingly character.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
And so it was whispered from lip to lip that
James Chalmers, the Greatheart of New Guinea,
was dead, dead, dead; although John Oxenham denied
it.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Greatheart is dead, they say!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Greatheart is dead, they say!<br/></span>
<span class="i4">Nor dead, nor sleeping! He lives on! His name<br/></span>
<span class="i4">Shall kindle many a heart to equal flame;<br/></span>
<span class="i4">The fire he kindled shall burn on and on<br/></span>
<span class="i4">Till all the darkness of the lands be gone,<br/></span>
<span class="i4">And all the kingdoms of the earth be won,<br/></span>
<span class="i4">And one!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">A soul so fiery sweet can never die<br/></span>
<span class="i0">But lives and loves and works through all eternity.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Yes, <i>lives</i> and <i>loves</i> and <i>works</i>! 'There will be
much to do in heaven,' he wrote to an old comrade
in one of the last letters he ever penned. 'I guess
I shall have good mission work to do; great, brave
work for Christ! He will have to find it, for I can
be nothing else than a missionary!' And so, perchance,
James Chalmers is a missionary still!
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
Now, underlying this brave story of a noble life
and a martyr-death is a great principle; and it is
the principle that, if we look, we shall find embedded
in the very heart of James Chalmers' text.
No law of life is more vital. Let us return to that
evangelistic meeting held on that drenching night
at Inverary, and let us catch once more those matchless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
cadences that won the heart of Chalmers! '<i>The
Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let him that
heareth say, Come; and let him that is athirst come;
and whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that is athirst come!</i>' 'I was athirst,'
says Chalmers, 'so I came!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that heareth say, Come!</i>' James
Chalmers <i>heard</i>; he felt that he must <i>say</i>; that is
the connecting link between the evangelistic meeting
at Inverary and the triumph and tragedy of New
Guinea.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that heareth, say!</i>'--that is the principle
embedded in the text. The soul's exports must
keep pace with the soul's imports. What I have
freely received, I must as freely give. The boons
that have descended to me from a remote ancestry
I must pass on with interest to a remote posterity.
The benedictions that my parents breathed on me
must be conferred by me upon my children. '<i>Let
him that heareth, say!</i>' What comes into the City
of Mansoul at Ear Gate must go out again at Lip
Gate. The auditor of one day must become the
orator of the next. It is a very ancient principle.
'He that reads,' says the prophet, 'must run!' 'He
that sees must spread!' With those quick eyes of
his, James Chalmers saw this at a glance. He recognized
that the kingdom of Christ could be established
in no other way. He saw that the Gospel
could have been offered him on no other terms.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
What, therefore, he had with such wonder heard,
he began, with great delight, to proclaim. Almost
at once he accepted a Sunday school class; the following
year he began preaching in those very villages
through which, as a boy, his exploratory wanderings
had so often taken him; a year later he
became a city missionary, that he might pass on the
message of the Spirit and the Bride to the teeming
poor of Glasgow; and, twelve months later still, he
entered college, in order to equip himself for service
in the uttermost ends of the earth. His boyish
passion for books and boxes had been sanctified at
last by his consecration to a great heroic mission.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
'<i>Let him that is athirst come!</i>' 'I was athirst,'
says Chalmers, 'and I came!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that heareth say, Come!</i>' And Chalmers,
having heard, said 'Come!' and said it with effect.
Dr. Lawes speaks of one hundred and thirty mission
stations which he established at New Guinea. And
look at this! 'On the first Sabbath in every month
not less than three thousand men and women gather
devotedly round the table of the Lord, reverently
commemorating the event which means so much to
them and to all the world. Many of them were
known to Chalmers as savages in feathers and war-paint.
Now, clothed and in their right mind, the
wild, savage look all gone, they form part of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Body of our Lord Jesus Christ and are members
of His Church. Many of the pastors who preside
at the Lord's Table bear on their breasts the tattoo
marks that indicate that their spears had been imbrued
with human blood. Now sixty-four of them,
thanks to Mr. Chalmers' influence, are teachers,
preachers and missionaries.' They, too, having listened,
proclaim; having received, give; having
heard, say; having been auditors, have now become
orators. They have read and therefore they run.
Having believed with the heart, they therefore confess
with the mouth. This is not only a law of
life; it is the law of the life everlasting. It is only
by loyalty to this golden rule, on the part of all
who hear the Spirit and the Bride say Come, that
the kingdoms of this world can become the kingdoms
of our God and of His Christ. It is the secret
of world-conquest; and, besides it, there is no other.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
'<i>The Spirit and the Bride say, Come; and let
him that heareth say, Come; and let him that is
athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take the
water of life freely.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that is athirst come!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that heareth say, Come!</i>'
</p>

<p>
I have somewhere read that, out in the solitudes
of the great dusty desert, when a caravan is in
peril of perishing for want of water, they give one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
camel its head and let him go. The fine instincts
of the animal will lead him unerringly to the refreshing
spring. As soon as he is but a speck on
the horizon, one of the Arabs mounts his camel and
sets off in the direction that the liberated animal
has taken. When, in his turn, he is scarcely distinguishable,
another Arab mounts and follows.
When the loose camel discovers water, the first
Arab turns and waves to the second; the second to
the third, and so on, until all the members of the
party are gathered at the satisfying spring. As each
man sees the beckoning hand, he turns and beckons
to the man behind him. He that sees, signals; he
that hears, utters. It is the law of the life everlasting;
it is the fundamental principle of James
Chalmers' text and of James Chalmers' life.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let him that is athirst come!</i>' 'I was athirst,'
says Chalmers, 'so I came!'
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">'Behold, I freely give<br/></span>
<span class="i0">The living water; thirsty one,<br/></span>

<p>
'<i>And now I live in Him.</i>' The life that James
Chalmers lived in his Lord was a life so winsome
that he charmed all hearts, a life so contagious that
savages became saints beneath his magnetic influence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
He had heard, at Inverary, the Spirit and
the Bride say, <i>Come!</i> And he esteemed it a privilege
beyond all price to be permitted to make the
abodes of barbarism and the habitations of cruelty
re-echo the matchless music of that mighty monosyllable.

<h3>SYDNEY CARTON'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Memory is the soul's best minister. Sydney Carton
found it so. On the greatest night of his life--the
night on which he resolved to lay down his life
for his friend--a text swept suddenly into his mind,
and, from that moment, it seemed to be written
everywhere. He was in Paris; the French Revolution
was at its height; sixty-three shuddering victims
had been borne that very day to the guillotine;
each day's toll was heavier than that of the day before;
no man's life was safe. Among the prisoners
awaiting death in the Conciergerie was Charles
Darnay, the husband of her whom Sydney himself
had loved with so much devotion but so little hope.
</p>

<p>
'O Miss Manette,' he had said, on the only occasion
on which he had revealed his passion, 'when,
in the days to come, you see your own bright beauty
springing up anew at your feet, think now and then
that there is a man who would give his life to keep
a life you love beside you!'
</p>

<p>
And now that hour had come. It happened that
Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton were, in form
and feature, extraordinarily alike. Darnay was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
doomed to die on the guillotine: Carton was free.
For the first time in his wayward life, Sydney saw
his course clearly before him. His years had been
spent aimlessly, but now he set his face like a flint
towards a definite goal. He stepped out into the
moonlight, not recklessly or negligently, but 'with
the settled manner of a tired man who had wandered
and struggled and got lost, but who at length
struck into his road and saw its end.' He would
find some way of taking Darnay's place in the
gloomy prison; he would, by his substitution, restore
her husband to Lucy's side; he would make his life
sublime at its close. His career should resemble a
day that, fitful and overcast, ends at length in a
glorious sunset. He would save his life by losing
it!
</p>

<p>
It was at that great moment that memory exercised
its sacred ministry upon the soul of Sydney
Carton. As he paced the silent streets, dark with
heavy shadows, the moon and the clouds sailing
high above him, he suddenly recalled the solemn
and beautiful words which he had heard read at
his father's grave: '<i>I am the Resurrection and the
Life; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead,
yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die.</i>' Sydney did not ask himself
why the words had rushed upon him at that hour,
although, as Dickens says, the reason was not far
to seek. But he kept repeating them. And, when
he stopped, the air seemed full of them. The great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
words were written across the houses on either side
of him; he looked up, and they were inscribed across
the dark clouds and the clear sky; the very echoes of
his footsteps reiterated them. When the sun rose,
it seemed to strike those words--the burden of the
night--straight and warm to his heart in its long
bright rays. Night and day were both saying the
same thing. He heard it everywhere: he saw it in
everything--
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Resurrection and the Life; he that believeth
in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall
never die.</i>'
</p>

<p>
That was Sydney Carton's text.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
It is a great thing--a very great thing--to be
able to save those you love by dying for them. I
well remember sitting in my study at Hobart one
evening, when there came a ring at the bell. A moment
later a man whom I knew intimately was
shown in. I had seen him a few weeks earlier, yet,
as I looked upon him that night, I could scarcely
believe it was the same man. He seemed twenty
years older; his hair was gray; his face furrowed
and his back bent. I was staggered at the change.
He sat down and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my boy, my boy!' he sobbed.
</p>

<p>
I let him take his time, and, when he had regained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
his self-possession, he told me of his son's
great sin and shame.
</p>

<p>
'I have mentioned this to nobody,' he said, 'but
I could keep it to myself no longer. I knew that
you would understand.'
</p>

<p>
And then he broke down again. I can see him
now as he sits there, rocking himself in his agony,
and moaning:
</p>

<p>
'If only I could have died for him! If only I
could have died for him!'
</p>

<p>
But he couldn't! That was the torture of it!
I remember how his heart-broken cry rang in my
ears for days; and on the following Sunday there
was only one subject on which I could preach.
'<i>And the king was much moved, and went up to the
chamber over the gate and wept; and as he went
he cried: O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom!
Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom,
my son, my son!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It was the unutterable grief of David, and of my
poor friend, that they could not save those they
loved by dying for them. It was the joy of Sydney
Carton that he could! He contrived to enter the
Conciergerie; made his way to Darnay's cell;
changed clothes with him; hurried him forth; and
then resigned himself to his fate. Later on, a fellow
prisoner, a little seamstress, approached him.
She had known Darnay and had learned to trust
him. She asked if she might ride with him to the
scaffold.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>
'I am not afraid,' she said, 'but I am little and
weak, and, if you will let me ride with you and hold
your hand, it will give me courage!'
</p>

<p>
As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw
a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
She had discovered that he was not Darnay.
</p>

<p>
'Are you dying for him?' she whispered.
</p>

<p>
'For him--and his wife and child. Hush! Yes!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, you will let me hold your brave hand,
stranger?'
</p>

<p>
'Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last!'
</p>

<p>
Nobody has ever read <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> without
feeling that this was the moment of Sydney
Carton's supreme triumph.
</p>

<p>
'It is,' he said--and they are the last words in
the book--'it is a far, far better thing that I do than
I have ever done!'
</p>

<p>
He had never tasted a joy to be compared with
this. He was able to save those he loved by dying
for them!
</p>

<p>
<i>That</i> is precisely the joy of the Cross! <i>That</i> was
the light that shone upon the Saviour's path through
all the darkness of the world's first Easter. <i>That</i> is
why, when He took the bread and wine--the emblems
of His body about to be broken and His blood
about to be shed--He gave thanks. It is <i>that</i>--and
that alone--that accounts for the fact that He
entered the Garden of Gethsemane with a song upon
His lips. It was for the joy that was set before Him
that He endured the Cross, despising its shame!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>
'Death!' He said. 'What of Death? <i>I am the
Life</i>, not only of Myself, but of all who place their
hands in Mine!
</p>

<p>
'The Grave! What of the Grave? <i>I am the
Resurrection!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Resurrection and the Life; he that believeth
in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never
die.</i>'
</p>

<p>
He felt that it was a great thing--a very great
thing--to be able to save those He loved by dying
for them.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
'<i>I am the Resurrection!</i>'--those were the words
that Sydney Carton saw written on land and on
water, on earth and on sky, on the night on which
he made up his mind to die. '<i>I am the Resurrection!</i>'
They were the words that he had heard read
beside his father's grave. They are the words that
we echo, in challenge and defiance, over <i>all</i> our
graves. The rubric of the Church of England requires
its ministers to greet the dead at the entrance
to the churchyard with the words: '<i>I am the Resurrection
and the Life</i>;' and, following the same sure
instinct, the ministers of all the other Churches
have adopted a very similar practice. The earth
seems to be a garden of graves. We speak of those
who have passed from us as 'the great majority.'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
We appear to be conquered. But it is all an illusion.
</p>

<p>
'O Grave!' we ask, in every burial service, 'where
is thy victory?' And the question answers itself.
The victory does not exist. The struggle is not yet
ended. '<i>I am the Resurrection!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Life!</i>'--that is what all the echoes were
saying as Sydney Carton, cherishing a great heroic
purpose in his heart, paced the deserted streets that
night.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Life! I am the Life!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>He that believeth in Me, though he were dead,
yet shall he live!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Whosoever believeth in Me shall never die!</i>'
</p>

<p>
That being so, what does death matter? 'O,
death!' we cry, 'where is thy sting?' and once more
the question answers itself.
</p>

<p>
'<i>O Death, where is thy sting?</i>'--'<i>I am the Life!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>O Grave, where is thy victory?</i>'--'<i>I am the Resurrection!</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>The Life and the Resurrection!</i> '<i>I am the Resurrection
and the Life!</i>'
</p>

<p>
The text that he saw in every sight, and heard
in every sound, made all the difference to Sydney
Carton. The end soon came, and this is how Dickens
tells the story.
</p>

<p>
The tumbrils arrive at the guillotine. The little
seamstress is ordered to go first. 'They solemnly
bless each other. The thin hand does not tremble
as he releases it. Nothing worse than a sweet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
bright constancy is in the patient face. She is gone.
The knitting women, who count the fallen heads,
murmur twenty-two. And then--
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Resurrection and the Life; he that believeth
in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;
and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never
die.</i>'
</p>

<p>
They said of him about the city that night that it
was the peacefullest man's face ever beheld there.
Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic.
</p>

<p>
<i>I am the Resurrection! O Grave, where is thy
victory?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I am the Life! O Death, where is thy sting?</i>
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
But there was more in Sydney Carton's experience
than we have yet seen. It happens that this
great saying about <i>the Resurrection and the Life</i>
is not only Sydney Carton's text; it is Frank Bullen's
text; and Frank Bullen's experience may help
us to a deeper perception of Sydney Carton's. In
his <i>With Christ at Sea</i>, Frank Bullen has a chapter
entitled 'The Dawn.' It is the chapter in which he
describes his conversion. He tells how, at a meeting
held in a sail-loft at Port Chalmers, in New Zealand,
he was profoundly impressed. After the
service, a Christian worker--whom I myself knew
well--engaged him in conversation. He opened a
New Testament and read these words: '<i>I am the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<i>Resurrection and the Life; he that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever
liveth and believeth in Me shall never die.</i>'
The earnest little gentleman pointed out the insistence
on faith: the phrase '<i>believeth in Me</i>' occurs
twice in the text: faith and life go together. Would
Frank Bullen exercise that faith?
</p>

<p>
'Every word spoken by the little man went right
to my heart,' Mr. Bullen assures us, 'and, when he
ceased, there was an appeal in his eyes that was
even more eloquent than his words. But beyond
the words and the look was the interpretation of
them to me by some mysterious agency beyond my
comprehension. For, in a moment, the hidden mystery
was made clear to me, and I said quietly, "I see,
sir; and I believe!" "Let us thank God!" answered
the little man, and together we knelt down by the
bench. There was no extravagant joy, no glorious
bursting into light and liberty, such as I have read
about as happening on those occasions; it was the
satisfaction of having found one's way after long
groping in darkness and misery--<i>the way that led
to peace</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Now the question is: did those words--the words
that came with such power to Frank Bullen in the
New Zealand sail-loft, and to Sydney Carton in the
Paris streets--have the same effect upon both? Did
they lead both of them to penitence and faith and
peace? I think they did. Let us return to Sydney
Carton as the sun is rising on that memorable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
morning on which he sees the text everywhere. He
leaves the streets in which he has wandered by
moonlight and walks beside a stream.
</p>

<p>
'A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened color
of a dead leaf, glided into his view, floated by him,
and died away. As its silent track in the water disappeared,
the prayer that had broken up out of his
heart for a merciful consideration of all his poor
blindnesses and errors ended in the words: "<i>I am
the Resurrection and the Life.</i>"'
</p>

<p>
'<i>He that believeth in Me ... whosoever believeth
in Me!</i>'--the insistent demand for faith.
</p>

<p>
'<i>He that believeth in Me!</i>'--Sydney Carton believed
and found peace.
</p>

<p>
'<i>He that believeth in Me!</i>'--Frank Bullen believed
and found peace.
</p>

<p>
Paul has a classical passage in which he shows
that those who have passed through experiences
such as these, have themselves '<i>risen with Christ
into newness of life</i>.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Risen with Christ!</i> They have found <i>the Resurrection</i>!
</p>

<p>
<i>Newness of life!</i> They have found <i>the Life</i>!
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Death in the Desert</i>, Browning describes
the attempts that were made to revive the sinking
man. It seemed quite hopeless. The most that he
would do was--
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To smile a little, as a sleeper does,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">If any dear one call him, touch his face--<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And smiles and loves, but will not be disturbed.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>
Then, all at once, the boy who had been assisting
in these proceedings, moved by some swift inspiration,
sprang from his knees and proclaimed a text:
'<i>I am the Resurrection and the Life!</i>' As if by
magic, consciousness revisited the prostrate form;
the man opened his eyes; sat up; stared about him;
and then began to speak. A wondrous virtue
seemed to lurk in the majestic words that the boy
recited. By that virtue Sydney Carton, Frank Bullen,
and a host of others passed from death into
life everlasting.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
I began by saying that it is a great thing--a very
great thing--to be able to save those you love by
dying for them.
</p>

<p>
I close by stating the companion truth. It is a
great thing--a very great thing--to have been died
for.
</p>

<p>
On the last page of his book Dickens tells us
what Sydney Carton would have seen and said if,
on the scaffold, it had been given him to read the
future.
</p>

<p>
'I see,' he would have exclaimed, 'I see the lives
for which I lay down my life--peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy--in that England which I
shall see no more. I see her with a child upon her
bosom who bears my name. I see that I hold <i>a sanctuary</i>
in all their hearts, and in the hearts of their
descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this
day. I see her and her husband, their course done,
lying side by side in their last earthly bed; and I
know that each was not more honored and held
sacred in the other's soul than I was in the souls
of both!'
</p>

<p>
'I see that I hold <i>a sanctuary in all their hearts</i>!'--it
is a lovely phrase.
</p>

<p>
It is a great thing--a very great thing--to have
been died for!
</p>

<p>
Wherefore let each man be at some pains to build
in his heart a sanctuary to Him who, for us men
and for our salvation, laid down His life with a
song!

<h3>EBENEZER ERSKINE'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
It is a lovely Sunday afternoon in the early summer
of the year 1690. The graceful and heathery
path that winds its way along the banks of the
Tweed, from the stately ruins of Melrose to the
crumbling gables of Dryburgh, is in its glory. The
wooded track by the waterside is luxuriating in
bright sunshine, glowing colors and soft shadows.
We are traversing one of the most charming and
romantic districts that even Scotland can present.
Here 'every field has its battle, every rivulet its
song.' More than a century hence, this historic
neighborhood is destined to furnish the home, and
fire the fancy, of Sir Walter Scott; and here, beneath
the vaulted aisle of Dryburgh's ancient abbey,
he will find his last resting-place. But that time
is not yet. Even now, however, in 1690, the hoary
cloister is only a battered and weatherbeaten fragment.
It is almost covered by the branches of the
trees that, planted right against the walls, have
spread their limbs like creepers over the mossy ruins,
as though endeavoring to protect the venerable pile.
And here, sitting on a huge slab that has fallen from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the broken arch above, is a small boy of ten. His
name is Ebenezer Erskine; he is the son of the
minister of Chirnside. Like his father, he was
born here at Dryburgh; and to-day the two are
revisiting the neighborhood round which so many
memories cluster. This morning the father, the
Rev. Henry Erskine, has been catechizing a group
of children at the kirk. He selected the questions
in the Shorter Catechism that relate to the Ten
Commandments; and the very first of the answers
that his father then taught him has made a profound
impression on Ebenezer's mind. The forty-third
question runs: '<i>What is the preface to the
Ten Commandments?</i>' And the answer is: '<i>The
preface to the Ten Commandments is in these words:
"I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee
out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of
bondage.</i>"' Other questions follow, and they, with
their attendant answers, have been duly memorized.
But they have failed to hold his thought. This one,
however, refuses to be shaken off. He has, quite
involuntarily, repeated it to himself a hundred times
as he pushed his way through the heather to the
mossy abbey. It sounds in his ears like a claim, a
challenge, an insistent and imperative demand.
</p>

<p>
<i>I am the Lord!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I am thy God!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The Lord! Thy God!</i>
</p>

<p>
It is his first realization of the fact that he is not
altogether his own.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Eighteen years have passed. He is now the minister
of the Portmoak parish. But it is a poor business.
'I began my ministry,' he says, 'without much
zeal, callously and mechanically, being swallowed up
in unbelief and in rebellion against God.' He feels
no enthusiasm for the Bible; indeed, the New Testament
positively wearies him. His sermons are long
and formal; he learns them by heart and repeats
them parrot-fashion, taking care to look, not into
the faces of his people, but at a certain nail in the
opposite wall. Happily for himself and for the
world, he has by this time married a wife to whom
the truth is no stranger. For years, poor Mrs.
Erskine has wept in secret over her husband's unregenerate
heart and unspiritual ministry. But now
a terrible sickness lays her low. Her brain is
fevered; she raves in her delirium; her words are
wild and passionate. Yet they are words that
smite her husband's conscience and pierce his very
soul. 'At last,' so runs the diary, 'the Lord was
pleased to calm her spirit and give her a sweet serenity
of mind. This, I think, was the first time that
ever I felt the Lord touching my heart in a sensible
manner. Her distress and her deliverance were
blessed to me. Some few weeks after, she and I
were sitting together in my study, and while we
were conversing about the things of God, the Lord
was pleased to rend the veil and to give me a glimmering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
view of salvation which made my soul
acquiesce in Christ as the new and living way to
glory.' The old text comes back to him.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Once more it sounds like a claim. And this time
he yields. He makes his vow in writing. '<i>I offer
myself up, soul and body, unto God the Father, Son
and Holy Ghost. I flee for shelter to the blood of
Jesus. I will live to Him; I will die to Him. I take
heaven and earth to witness that all I am and all I
have are His.</i>'
</p>

<p>
Thus, on August 26, 1708, Ebenezer Erskine
makes his covenant. 'That night,' he used to say,
'I got my head out of Time into Eternity!'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Ten more years have passed. It is now 1718;
Ebenezer Erskine is thirty-eight. Filled with concern
for the souls of his people at Portmoak, he
preaches a sermon on the text that had played so
great a part in bringing his own spirit out of
bondage.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>'
</p>

<p>
As he preaches, the memory of his own experience
rushes back upon him. His soul catches
fire. He is one moment persuasive and the next
peremptory. No sermon that he ever preached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
made a greater impression on his congregation; and,
when it was printed, it proved to be the most effective
and fruitful of all his publications.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
Five and thirty further years have run their
course. Mr. Erskine is now seventy-three. He has
passed through the fires of persecution, and, in days
of tumult and unrest, has proved himself a leader
whom the people have delighted, at any cost, to
follow. But his physical frame is exhausted. An
illness overtakes him which, continuing for over a
year, at last proves fatal. His elders drop in from
time to time to read and pray with him. To-day
one of them, the senior member of the little band,
is moved, in taking farewell of his dying minister,
to ask a question of him. After grasping the sick
man's hand and moving towards the door, a sudden
impulse seizes him and he returns to the bedside.
</p>

<p>
'You have often given us good advice, Mr.
Erskine,' he says, 'as to what we should do with
our souls in life and in death; may I ask what you
are now doing with your own?'
</p>

<p>
'I am just doing with it,' the old man replies,
'what I did forty years ago; I am resting it on that
word, "<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>"'
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
Now what was it, I wonder, that Ebenezer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Erskine saw in this string of monosyllables as he
sat on the fallen slab beside the ruined abbey in
1690, as he sat conversing with his convalescent
wife in 1708, as he preached with such passion in
1718, and as he lay dying in 1753? What, to him,
was the significance of that great sentence that, as
the catechism says, forms '<i>the preface to the Ten
Commandments</i>'? Ebenezer Erskine saw, underlying
the words, two tremendous principles. They
convinced him that <i>the Center must always be
greater than the Circumference</i> and they convinced
him that <i>the Positive must always be greater than
the Negative</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Center must always be greater than the Circumference</i>,
for, without the center, there can be
no circumference. And there, in the very first
word of this 'preface to the Ten Commandments,'
stands the august center around which all the mandates
revolve. '<i>I</i> am the Lord thy God.' 'I have
many times essayed,' Luther tells us in his <i>Table-Talk</i>,
'thoroughly to investigate the Ten Commandments;
but at the very outset--"<i>I am the Lord thy
God</i>"--I stuck fast. That single word "<i>I</i>" put me
to a non-plus.' I am not surprised. The man who
would enter this Palace of Ten Chambers will find
God awaiting him on the threshold; and he must
make up his mind as to his relationship with Him
before he can pass on to investigate the interior of
the edifice. In learning his Shorter Catechism that
Sunday morning at Dryburgh, Ebenezer Erskine,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
then a boy of ten, had come face to face with God;
and he felt that he dared not proceed to the <i>Circumference</i>
until his heart was in harmony with
the <i>Center</i>.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
He felt, too, that the <i>Positive</i> must precede the
<i>Negative</i>. The <i>person</i> of the most High must come
before the <i>precepts</i> of the Most High; the <i>Thou
Shalts</i> must come before the <i>Thou Shalt Nots</i>. The
superstructure of a personal religion cannot be
reared on a foundation of negatives. Life can only
be constructed positively. The soul cannot flourish
on a principle of subtraction; it can only prosper
on a principle of addition. It is at this point that we
perpetrate one of our commonest blunders. Between
Christmas Day and New Year's Day, we
invariably frame a variety of good resolutions; we
register a number of excellent resolves. But, for the
most part, they come to nothing; and they come to
nothing because they are so largely negative. 'I
will never again do such-and-such a thing'; 'I will
never again behave in such-and-such a way'; and
so on. We have failed to discover the truth that
gripped the soul of Ebenezer Erskine that day at
Dryburgh. He saw, as he repeated to himself his
catechism, that the Ten Commandments consist of
three parts.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(1) <i>The Preface</i>--'<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>'<br/></span>
<span class="i0">(2) <i>The Precepts</i>--'<i>Thou shalt ...</i>'<br/></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(3) <i>The Prohibitions</i>--'<i>Thou shall not ...</i>'<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Our New Year's resolutions assume that we
should put third things first. We are wrong. As
Ebenezer Erskine saw, we must put the <i>Person</i> before
the <i>Precepts</i>, and the <i>Precepts</i> before the <i>Prohibitions</i>.
The <i>Center</i> must come before the <i>Circumference</i>;
the <i>Positive</i> before the <i>Negative</i>.
</p>

<p>
When, at the end of December, we pledge ourselves
so desperately to do certain things no more,
we entirely forget that our worst offenses do not
consist in outraging the <i>Thou Shalt Nots</i>; our worst
offenses consist in violating the <i>Thou Shalts</i>. The
revolt of the soul against the divine <i>Prohibitions</i>
is as nothing compared with the revolt of the soul
against the divine <i>Precepts</i>; just as the revolt of
the soul against the divine <i>Precepts</i> is as nothing
compared with the revolt of the soul against the
<i>Divine Person</i>. It is by a flash of real spiritual
insight that, in the General Confession in the Church
of England Prayer Book, the clause, '<i>We have left
undone those things which we ought to have done</i>,'
precedes the clause, '<i>And we have done those things
which we ought not to have done.</i>' In his <i>Ecce
Homo</i>, Sir John Seeley has pointed out the radical
difference between the villains of the parables and
the villains that figure in all other literature. In the
typical novel the villain is a man who does what he
ought not to do; in the tales that Jesus told the villain
is a man who leaves undone what he ought to
have done. 'The sinner whom Christ denounces,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
says Sir John, 'is he who has done nothing; the
priest and the Levite who passed by on the other
side; the rich man who allowed the beggar to lie
unhelped at his gate; the servant who hid in a napkin
the talent intrusted to him; the unprofitable
hireling who did only what it was his duty to do.'
Christ's villains are the men who sin against the
<i>Person</i> and the <i>Precepts</i> of the Most High; he
scarcely notices the men who violate the <i>Prohibitions</i>.
Yet it is of the <i>Prohibitions</i> that, when New
Years come, we think so much.

</div></div>

<p>
During a ministry of nearly thirty years, it has
been my privilege and duty to deal with men and
women of all kinds and conditions. I have attended
hundreds of deathbeds. In reviewing those
experiences to-day, I cannot remember a single case
of a man who found it difficult to believe that God
could forgive those things that he ought not to
have done and had done; and I cannot recall a single
case of a man who found it easy to believe that God
could forgive those things that he ought to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
done but had left undone. It is our sins against
the divine <i>Precepts</i> that sting most venomously at
the last:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The sad, sad child whose joy thou hast not planned;<br/></span>

</div></div>

<p>
Ebenezer Erskine saw that day at Dryburgh that
he must recognize the inspired order. He must
bow first of all to the authority of the Divine <i>Person</i>;
he must recognize the obligations involved in
the Divine <i>Precepts</i>; and, after this, he must eschew
those things that are forbidden by the Divine <i>Prohibitions</i>.
That order he never forgot.
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
George Macdonald tells us how, when the Marquis
of Lossie was dying, he sent post-haste for Mr.
Graham, the devout schoolmaster. Mr. Graham
knew his man and went cautiously to work.
</p>

<p>
'Are you satisfied with yourself my lord?'
</p>

<p>
'No, by God!'
</p>

<p>
'You would like to be better?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but how is a poor devil to get out of this
infernal scrape?'
</p>

<p>
'Keep the commandments!'
</p>

<p>
'That's it, of course; but there's no time!'
</p>

<p>
'If there were but time to draw another breath,
there would be time to begin!'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>
'How am I to begin? Which am I to begin
with?'
</p>

<p>
'There is one commandment which includes all
the rest!'
</p>

<p>
'Which is that?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt
be saved!</i>'
</p>

<p>
What did the schoolmaster mean? He meant
that the <i>Person</i> must precede the <i>Precepts</i>, as the
<i>Precepts</i> must precede the <i>Prohibitions</i>; he was insisting
on the divine order; that was all. And I
feel confident that <i>that</i> was the burden of that
powerful sermon that Ebenezer Erskine preached
to his people at Portmoak in 1718. His last illness,
as I have said, continued for twelve months. It
was in its earlier stages that the old elder asked
his question and received his minister's testimony
concerning the text. A year later Mr. Erskine referred
to the words again. On the morning of the
first of June, he awoke from a brief sleep, and, seeing
his daughter, Mrs. Fisher, sitting reading by
his bedside, he asked her the name of the book.
</p>

<p>
'I am reading one of your own sermons, father!'
</p>

<p>
'Which one?'
</p>

<p>
'The one on "<i>I am the Lord thy God!</i>"'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, lass,' he exclaimed, his face lighting up, as
a wave of sacred memories swept over him, 'that
is the best sermon ever I preached!'
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later he closed his eyes, slipped
his hand under his cheek, composed himself on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
pillow, and ceased to breathe. The noble spirit of
Ebenezer Erskine was with God.
</p>

<p>
Ebenezer Erskine reminds me of his great predecessor,
Samuel Rutherford. When Rutherford
was staying for a while at the house of James
Guthrie, the maid was surprised at hearing a voice
in his room. She had supposed he was alone.
Moved by curiosity, she crept to his door. She then
discovered that Rutherford was in prayer. He
walked up and down the room, exclaiming, '<i>O Lord,
make me to believe in Thee!</i>' Then, after a pause,
he moved to and fro again, crying, '<i>O Lord, make
me to love Thee!</i>' And, after a second rest, he
rose again, praying, '<i>O Lord, make me to keep all
Thy commandments!</i>' Rutherford, like Erskine a
generation later, had grasped the spiritual significance
of the divine order.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Make me to believe in Thee!</i>'--the commandment
that, as the schoolmaster told the Marquis,
includes all the commandments!
</p>

<p>
'<i>Make me to love Thee!</i>'--for love, as Jesus told
the rich young ruler, is the fulfilment of the whole
law.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Make me to obey all Thy commandments!</i>'
</p>

<p>
The man who learns the Ten Commandments at
the school of Samuel Rutherford or at the school of
Ebenezer Erskine will see a shining path that runs
from Mount Sinai right up to the Cross and on
through the gates of pearl into the City of God.

<h3>DOCTOR DAVIDSON'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
There are only two things worth mentioning
in connection with Dr. Davidson, but they are both
of them very beautiful. The one was his life: the
other was his death. Ian Maclaren tells us that the
old doctor had spent practically all his days as minister
at Drumtochty. He was the father of all the
folk in the glen. He was consulted about everything.
Three generations of young people had, in
turn, confided to his sympathetic ear the story of
their loves and hopes and fears; rich and poor had
alike found in him a guide in the day of perplexity
and a comforter in the hour of sorrow. And now
it is Christmas Day--the doctor's last Christmas--and
a Sunday. The doctor had preached as usual
in the kirk; had trudged through the snow to greet
with seasonable wishes and gifts one or two people
who might be feeling lonely or desolate; and now,
the day's work done, was entertaining Drumsheugh
at the manse. All at once, he began to speak of his
ministry, lamenting that he had not done better
for his people, and declaring that, if he were spared,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
he intended to preach more frequently about the
Lord Jesus Christ.
</p>

<p>
'You and I, Drumsheugh, will have to go a long
journey soon, and give an account of our lives in
Drumtochty. Perhaps we have done our best as
men can, and I think we have tried; but there are
many things we might have done otherwise, and
some we ought not to have done at all. It seems
to me now, the less we say in that day of the past,
the better. We shall wish for mercy rather than
justice, and'--here the doctor looked earnestly over
his glasses at his elder--'we would be none the
worse, Drumsheugh, of a Friend to say a good word
for us both in the Great Court!'
</p>

<p>
'A've thocht that masel'--it was an agony for
Drumsheugh to speak--'a've thocht that masel mair
than aince. Weelum MacLure was ettlin' aifter the
same thing the nicht he slippit awa, and gin ony
man cud hae stude on his ain feet yonder, it was
Weelum.'
</p>

<p>
It was the doctor's last conversation. When his
old servant entered the room next morning, he
found his master sitting silent and cold in his chair.
</p>

<p>
'We need a Friend in the Great Court!' said the
doctor.
</p>

<p>
'A've thocht that masel!' replied Drumsheugh.
</p>

<p>
'Weelum MacLure was ettlin' after the same
thing the nicht he slippit awa!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>For there is one God, and one Mediator between
God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</i>'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
My Bible contains two stories--one near its beginning
and one near its end--which to-day I must
lay side by side. The <i>first</i> is the story of a man
who feels that he is suffering more than his share
of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.
He thinks of God as very high and very holy; too
wise to err and too good to be unkind; yet he cannot
shake from his mind the conviction that God
has misunderstood him. And, in his agony, he
cries out for one who can arbitrate between his
tortured soul and the God who seems to be so
angry with him. Oh, for one a little less divine
than God, yet a little less human than himself, who
could act as an adjudicator, an umpire, a mediator
between them! But neither the heavens above nor
the earth beneath can produce one capable of ending
the painful controversy. 'There is no daysman who
can come between us and lay his hand upon us
both!'
</p>

<p>
<i>A God!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>But no Mediator!</i>
</p>

<p>
That is the <i>first</i> story.
</p>

<p>
The <i>second</i> story, the story from the end of the
Bible, is the story of an old minister whose life-work
is finished. He writes, in a reminiscent vein,
to a young minister who is just beginning; and
earnestly refers to his own ordination. 'Whereunto,'
he asks, 'was I ordained a preacher and an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and
verity?' What is his message? He answers his
own question. It is this. '<i>For there is one God,
and one Mediator between God and men, the Man
Christ Jesus.</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>A God!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>And a Mediator!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Job</i> needed a Friend in the Great Court; but,
alas, he could not find one!
</p>

<p>
<i>Paul</i> tells Timothy that he was ordained for no
other purpose than to point men to Him who alone
can intercede.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
'<i>One God--but no Mediator!</i>' cries Job.
</p>

<p>
'<i>One God--and one Mediator!</i>' exclaims Paul.
</p>

<p>
In one respect these two thinkers, standing with
a long, long file of centuries between them, are in
perfect agreement. They both feel that if there is
a God--and only one--no man living can afford to
drift into alienation from Him. If there is <i>no</i> God,
I can live as I list and do as I please; I am answerable
to nobody. If there are <i>many gods</i>, I can offend
one or two of them without involving myself
in uttermost disaster and despair. But if there is
<i>one</i> God, and only one, everything depends upon
my relationship with Him. And if I am already
estranged from Him, and if there be no Mediator
by whose good offices a reconciliation may be effected,
then am I of all men most miserable.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>
'<i>One God--but no Mediator!</i>' cried Job in
despair.
</p>

<p>
<i>'One God--and one Mediator!</i>' exclaims Paul,
in delight.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
'<i>One God--and one Mediator!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It is the glory of our humanity that it needs both
the one and the other. We need a God and cannot
be happy till we find Him. The instinct of adoration
is in our blood, and we are ill at ease until we
can find One at whose feet we can lay the tribute
of our devotion. We need a Mediator, too, and are
at our best when we recognize and confess our
need of Him. It is, I say, the glory of a man that
he can yearn for these two things. The most
faithful and intelligent of the beasts feel no desire
for either the one or the other. We know how Dr.
Davidson died. I said that his conversation with
Drumsheugh was his last. I was mistaken. His
last conversation was with Skye, his dog. When
John, the serving-man, paid his usual visit to the
study before he went to bed, the doctor did not hear
him enter the room. He was holding converse with
Skye, who was seated on a chair, looking very wise
and deeply interested.
</p>

<p>
'Ye're a bonnie beastie, Skye,' exclaimed the doctor,
'for a' thing He made is verra gude. Ye've
been true and kind to your master, Skye, and ye 'ill
miss him if he leaves ye. Some day ye 'ill die
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
also, and they 'ill bury ye, and I doubt that 'ill be
the end o' ye, Skye! Ye never heard o' God, Skye,
or the Saviour, for ye're just a puir doggie; but
your master is minister of Drumtochty and--a sinner
saved by grace!'
</p>

<p>
Those were his last words. In the morning the
doctor was still sitting in his big chair, and Skye
was fondly licking a hand that would never again
caress him.
</p>

<p>
Skye, the noblest dog in the world, had no sense
of sin and no sense of grace, no need of a God and
no need of a Saviour!
</p>

<p>
Dr. Davidson, Skye's master, is a sinner saved
by grace. And it is his sense of sin and his sense
of grace, his need of a God and his need of a
Saviour, that remove him by whole infinities from
the faithful brute on the chair. 'A sinner,' as our
fathers used to sing:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A sinner is a sacred thing,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">The Holy Ghost hath made him so.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
When the soul feels after God, and the heart cries
out for a Saviour, it is proof positive of the divinity
that dwells within us.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
'<i>One God--but no Mediator!</i>' sighs Job.
</p>

<p>
'<i>One God--and one Mediator!</i>' cries Paul.
</p>

<p>
None! One! The difference between <i>none</i> and
<i>one</i> is a difference of millions. <i>None</i> means nothing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
<i>one</i> means everything. <i>None</i> means failure: <i>one</i>
means felicity. <i>None</i> means despair: <i>one</i> means
delight. <i>None</i> means perdition: <i>one</i> means paradise.
The difference between '<i>no Mediator</i>' and '<i>one Mediator</i>'
is a difference that can never be worked out
by arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
'<i>One God</i>'--and only one!
</p>

<p>
'<i>And one Mediator!</i>'--only one!
</p>

<p>
But one is enough. It is only in the small things
of life that I long for a selection; in the great
things of life I only long for satisfaction. When my
appetite is sated, and food is almost a matter of
indifference to me, I like to be invited to choose
between this, that, and the other. But when I am
starving, I do not hanker after a choice. I do not
want to choose. Put food before me, and I am content.
If I am taking a stroll for the mere pleasure
of walking, I like to come to a place where several
roads meet, and to select the path that seems to be
most tempting. But if, weary and travelworn, I
am struggling desperately homewards, I do not want
to have to choose my path. I dread the place where
many roads meet--the place where I may go astray.
My felicity lies in simplicity: I want but one road
if that road leads home. Robinson Crusoe climbs
the hills of his island solitude and shades his eyes
with his hand as he sweeps the watery horizon. He
is looking for a sail. <i>One</i> ship will do: he does not
want a fleet. There is but <i>one</i> way of salvation for
my storm-tossed soul: there is but <i>one</i> Name given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
under heaven among men whereby we must be
saved: '<i>there is one God and one Mediator between
God and Men</i>'--and <i>one</i> is ample. The difference
between '<i>no Mediator</i>' and '<i>one Mediator</i>' is a difference
that has all eternity within it.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
But it is time that we came to close quarters.
There are two people in every congregation with
whom the minister finds it very difficult to deal.
There is the man upon whose conscience sin lies
very heavily, and there is the man upon whose soul
it sits very lightly.
</p>

<p>
The <i>first</i> of these two perplexing individuals is
afraid to approach the Mediator. He feels it to
be a kind of presumption. It is difficult to argue
with him. It is better to introduce him to Robert
Murray McCheyne. McCheyne had the same feeling.
'I am ashamed to go to Christ,' he says. 'I
feel, when I have sinned, that it would do no good
to go. It seems to be making Christ a Minister of
Sin to go straight from the swine-trough to the
best robe.' But he came to see that there is no
other way, and that all his plausible reasonings were
but the folly of his own beclouded heart. 'The
weight of my sin,' he writes, 'should act like the
weight of a clock; the heavier it is, the faster it
makes it go!'
</p>

<p>
And the <i>second</i> of these difficult cases--the man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
upon whose conscience sin sits so lightly--I shall
introduce to Dr. MacLure. As Drumsheugh told
Dr. Davidson on that snowy Christmas night, 'if
ever there was a man who could have stood on his
own feet in the Day of Judgment, it was William
MacLure.' Through all his long years in the glen,
the old doctor had simply lived for others. As
long as he could cure his patients he was content;
and he was never happier than in handing the sick
child back to its parents or in restoring the wife
to the husband who had despaired of her recovery.
If ever there was a man who could have stood on
his own feet in the Day of Judgment, it was William
MacLure. Yet when the old doctor came to
the end of his long journey, his soul was feeling
after the same thing--a Friend in the Great Court,
an Intercessor, a Mediator between God and men!
</p>

<p>
'We have done our best,' said the old minister,
in that last talk with his elder, 'we have done our
best, but the less we say about it the better. We
need a Friend to say a good word for us in the
Great Court.'
</p>

<p>
'A've thocht that masel,' replied the agonized
elder, 'mair than aince. Weelum MacLure was
'ettling aifter the same thing the nicht he slippit
awa, an' gin ony man cud hae stude on his ain feet
yonder, it was Weelum.'
</p>

<p>
And for minister and elder and doctor--and me--'<i>there
is one God and one Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus</i>.'

<h3>HENRY MARTYN'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
With Henry Martyn the making of history became
a habit, a habit so inveterate that not even
death itself could break him of it. He only lived
to be thirty-two; but he made vast quantities of
history in that meager handful of years. 'His,'
says Sir James Stephen, 'is the one heroic name
which adorns the annals of the English church from
the days of Elizabeth to our own.' And Dr. George
Smith, his biographer, boasts that Martyn's life constitutes
itself the priceless and perpetual heritage of
all English-speaking Christendom, whilst the native
churches of India, Arabia, Persia and Anatolia
will treasure the thought of it through all time to
come. Appropriately enough, Macaulay, who dedicated
his brilliant powers to the great task of
worthily recording the history that other men had
made, composed the epitaph for that lonely Eastern
tomb.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here Martyn lies! In manhood's early bloom<br/></span>

<span class="i0">Onward he journeyed to a happier shore,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Where danger, death and shame are known no more.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
For more than a hundred years the bones of
Henry Martyn have reposed in that far-off Oriental
sepulcher; but, as though he had never heard of
his own decease, he goes on making history still.
Henry Martyn died seven years before George Eliot
was born, and they had very little in common.
But, in the novel which Dr. Marcus Dods described
as 'one of the greatest religious books ever written,'
George Eliot makes the spiritual crisis in the experience
of her storm-beaten and distracted heroine to
turn on the perusal of the <i>Life of Henry Martyn</i>.
When Janet Dempster, clad only in her thin nightdress,
was driven at dead of night from her husband's
home, she took refuge with good old Mrs.
Pettifer, and fell into a stupor of utter misery and
black despair. Nothing seemed to rouse her. It
chanced, however, that Mrs. Pettifer was a subscriber
of the Paddiford Lending Library. From
that village treasure-trove she had borrowed the
biography that was lying on the table when, like a
hunted deer, poor Janet took shelter in her home.
After a day or two, Janet picked up the book, dipped
into it, and at length 'became so arrested by that
pathetic missionary story that she could not leave
it alone.' It broke the spell of her stupor, gave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
her a new hold upon life, awoke her dormant energy,
and moved her to renewed action.
</p>

<p>
'I must go,' she said. 'I feel I must be doing
something for someone; I must not be a mere useless
log any longer. I've been reading about that
wonderful Henry Martyn wearing himself out for
<i>other people</i>, and I sit thinking of nothing but
<i>myself</i>! I must go! Good-bye!'
</p>

<p>
And, like a frightened dove that, having been
driven to shelter by a hawk, recovers from its
terror and again takes wing, off she went! Janet
Dempster is all the more real because she is unreal.
She is all the more a substance because she is only
a shadow. She is all the more symbolic and typical
because she appears, not in history, but in fiction.
If I had found her in the realm of biography, I
might have regarded hers as an isolated and exceptional
case. But, since I have found her in the
realm of romance, I can only regard her--as her
creator intended me to regard her--as a great representative
character. She represents all those thousands
of people upon whom the heroic record of
Henry Martyn's brief career has acted as a stimulant
and a tonic. She represents all those thousands
of people through whom Henry Martyn is making
history.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
The Gospels tell of a certain man who was <i>borne
of four</i> to the feet of Jesus. I know his name and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
I know the names of the four who brought him.
The man's name was Henry Martyn, and the quartet
consisted of a father, a sister, an author and
a minister. Each had a hand in the gracious work,
and each in a different way. The father did his
part accidentally, indirectly, unconsciously; the sister
did her part designedly, deliberately, and of set
purpose. The author and the minister did their
parts in the ordinary pursuit of their vocations; but
the <i>author</i> did his part impersonally and indirectly,
whilst the <i>minister</i> did his part personally and face
to face. The author's shaft was from a bow drawn
at a venture; the minister's was carefully aimed.
He set himself to win the young student in his congregation,
and he lived to rejoice unfeignedly in
his success. Let me introduce each of the four.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Father bore his Corner.</i> Before Henry Martyn
left England, he was one of the most brilliant
students in the country, Senior Wrangler of his
University, and the proud holder of scholarships
and fellowships. But, in his earlier days, he failed
at one or two examinations, and, in his mortification,
heaped the blame upon his father. In one of these
fits of passion, he bounced out of the elder man's
presence--never to enter it again. Before he could
return and express contrition, the father suddenly
died. Henry's remorse was pitiful to see. His heart
was filled with grief and his eyes swollen with tears.
But that torrent of tears so cleansed those eyes that
he was able to see, as he had never seen before,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
into the abysmal depths of his own heart. He was
astonished at the baseness and depravity he found
there. Years afterwards he writes with emotion
of the distressing discovery that he then made. 'I
do not remember a time,' he says, 'in which the
wickedness of my heart rose to a greater height
than it did then. The consummate selfishness and
exquisite instability of my mind were displayed in
rage, malice and envy; in pride, vain-glory and contempt
for all about me; and in the harsh language
which I used to my sister and even to my father.
Oh, what an example of patience and mildness was
he! I love to think of his excellent qualities; and it
is the anguish of my heart that I could ever have
been base enough and wicked enough to have pained
him. O my God, why is not my heart doubly-agonized
at the remembrance of all my great transgressions?'
So poor John Martyn, lying silent in his
grave, entered into that felicity which, in one of her
short poems, Miss Susan Best has so touchingly depicted.
'When I was laid in my coffin,' she makes
a dead man say,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I was laid in my coffin,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Quite done with Time and its fears,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">My son came and stood beside me--<br/></span>
<span class="i2">He hadn't been home for years;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And right on my face came dripping<br/></span>
<span class="i2">The scald of his salty tears;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And I was glad to know his breast<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Had turned at last to the old home nest,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">That I said to myself in an underbreath:<br/></span>
<span class="i0">'This is the recompense of death.'<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>The Sister bore her Corner.</i> In his letters to her
he opens all his heart. He is sometimes angry with
her because, when he expected her to show delight
in his academic triumphs, she only exhibits an
earnest solicitude for his spiritual well-being. But,
in his better moments, he forgave her. 'What a
blessing it is for me,' he writes to her in his twentieth
year, 'what a blessing it is for me that I have
such a sister as you, who have been so instrumental
in keeping me in the right way.' And, later on, he
delights her by telling her that he 'has begun to
attend more diligently to the words of the Saviour
and to devour them with delight.'
</p>

<p>
<i>The Author bore his Corner.</i> It was just about
a hundred years after the birth of Philip Doddridge,
and just about fifty years after his death, that his
book, <i>The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul</i>,
fell into the hands of Henry Martyn. Twenty years
earlier it had opened the eyes of William Wilberforce
and led him to repentance. Doddridge's
powerful sentences fell upon the proud soul of
Henry Martyn like the lashes of a scourge. He resented
them; he writhed under their condemnation;
but they revealed to him the desperate need of his
heart, and he could not shake from him the alarm
which they excited.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Minister bore his Corner.</i> No preacher in
England was better fitted to appeal to the mind of
Martyn, at this critical stage of his career, than
was the Rev. Charles Simeon, the Vicar of Trinity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Church, Cambridge. In his concern, the young
collegian found himself strangely attracted to the
services at Trinity; and he gradually acquired, as
he confessed to his sister, more knowledge in divine
things. He made the acquaintance, and won the
friendship, of Mr. Simeon, and confided in him
without reserve. 'I now experienced,' he says, 'a
real pleasure in religion, being more deeply convinced
of sin than before, more earnest in fleeing
to Jesus for refuge, and more desirous for the renewal
of my nature.' The profit was mutual. For,
many years after Henry Martyn's departure and
death, Mr. Simeon kept in his study a portrait of
the young student, and he used to say that he could
never look into that face but it seemed to say to him,
'Be earnest! Be earnest!'
</p>

<p>
And so, to repeat the language of the Gospel,
'<i>there came unto Jesus one that was borne of four</i>,'
and his name was Henry Martyn.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
I cannot discover that, up to this point, any one
text had played a conspicuous part in precipitating
the crisis which transfigured his life. But, after this,
I find one sentence repeatedly on his lips. During
a journey a man is often too engrossed with the
perplexities of the immediate present to be able
to review the path as a whole. But, when he looks
back, he surveys the entire landscape in grateful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
retrospect, and is astonished at the multiplicity and
variety of the perils that he has escaped. Henry
Martyn had some such feeling. When, at the age
of twenty-two, he entered the ministry, he was
amazed at the greatness of the grace that had made
such hallowed privileges and sacred duties possible
to him. Even in his first sermon, we are told, he
preached with a fervor of spirit and an earnestness
of manner that deeply impressed the congregation.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He preached as one who ne'er should preach again,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And as a dying man to dying men.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
'For,' he wrote, '<i>I am but a brand plucked from the
burning</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Again, when the needs of the world pressed like
an intolerable burden upon his spirit, the same
thought decided his course. On the <i>one</i> hand, he
saw a world lying in darkness and crying for the
light. On the <i>other</i> hand, he saw all those sweet
and sacred ties that bound him to his native land--his
devoted people, his admiring friends, and,
hardest tie of all to break, the lady whom he had
fondly hoped to make his bride. Here, on the <i>one</i>
hand, stood comfort, popularity, success and love!
And here, on the <i>other</i>, stood cruel hardship, endless
difficulties, constant loneliness, and an early
grave! 'But how,' he writes, 'can I hesitate? <i>I am
but a brand plucked from the burning!</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand in peril of sharing the general destruction!</i>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>
<i>A brand seen, and prized, and rescued!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand at whose blaze other flames might be lit!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand plucked from the burning!</i>
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
'<i>Is not this a brand plucked from the burning?</i>'--it
was John Wesley's text. To the end of his
days John Wesley preserved the picture of the fire
at the old rectory, the fire from which he, as a child
of six, was only rescued in the nick of time. And,
underneath the picture, John Wesley had written
with his own hand the words: '<i>Is not this a brand
plucked from the burning?</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Is not this a brand plucked from the burning?</i>'--it
was John Fletcher's text. John Wesley
thought John Fletcher, the Vicar of Madeley, the
holiest man then living. 'I have known him intimately
for thirty years,' says Mr. Wesley. 'In my
eighty years I have met many excellent men; but
I have never met his equal, nor do I expect to find
such another on this side of eternity.' From what
source did that perennial stream of piety spring?
'When I saw that all my endeavors availed nothing,'
says Mr. Fletcher, in describing his conversion, 'I
almost gave up hope. But, I thought, Christ died
for <i>all</i>; therefore He died for <i>me</i>. He died to
pluck such sinners as I am <i>as brands from the burning</i>!
I felt my helplessness and lay at the feet of
Christ. I cried, coldly, yet, I believe, sincerely,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
"Save me, Lord, <i>as a brand snatched out of the fire</i>!
Stretch forth Thine almighty arm and save Thy
lost creature by free, unmerited grace!"'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Is not this a brand plucked from the burning?</i>'--it
was Thomas Olivers' text. Thomas Olivers
was one of Wesley's veterans, the author of the
well-known hymn, 'The God of Abraham praise.'
He went one day to hear George Whitefield preach.
The text was, '<i>Is not this a brand plucked from the
burning?</i>' 'When the sermon began,' he says, 'I
was certainly a dreadful enemy to God and to all
that is good, and one of the most profligate and
abandoned young men living; but, by the time it
was ended, I was become a new creature. For, in
the first place, I was deeply convinced of the great
goodness of God towards me in all my life; particularly
in that He had given His Son to die for
me. I had also a far clearer view of all my sins,
particularly my base ingratitude towards Him.
These discoveries quite broke my heart and caused
showers of tears to trickle down my cheeks. I was
likewise filled with an utter abhorrence of my evil
ways, and was much ashamed that I had ever
walked in them. And, as my heart was thus turned
from all that is evil, so it was powerfully inclined
to all that is good. It is not easy to express what
strong desires I felt for God and His service; and
what resolutions I made to seek Him and serve Him
in the future. In consequence of this, I broke off
all my evil practices, and forsook all my wicked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and foolish companions without delay. I gave myself
up to God and His service with my whole heart.
Oh, what reason have I to say, "<i>Is not this a brand
plucked from the burning?</i>"'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Is not this a brand plucked from the burning?</i>'--it
was Stephen Grellet's text. Writing of his
conversion, he says that 'the awfulness of that day
of God's visitation can never cease to be remembered
by me with peculiar gratitude as long as I
possess my mental faculties. I am <i>as a brand
plucked from the burning</i>; I have been rescued
from the brink of a horrible pit!'
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
And it was Henry Martyn's text! '<i>Is not this</i>,'
he cried, as he entered the ministry, and again as
he entered the mission field, '<i>is not this a brand
plucked from the burning?</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand that might have perished in the general
destruction!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand seen, and prized, and rescued!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand at whose blaze other flames might be lit!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>A brand plucked from the burning!</i>
</p>

<p>
'Oh, let me burn out for my God!' he cries, still
thinking of the brand plucked from the flames. He
plunges, like a blazing torch, into the darkness of
India, of Persia and of Turkey. He leaves the
peoples whom he has evangelized the Scriptures in
their own tongues. Seven short years after he left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
England, he dies all alone on a foreign strand. 'No
kinsman is near to watch his last look or receive
his last words. No friend stands by his couch to
whisper comforting words, to close his eyes or
wipe the death-sweat from his brow.' In the article
of death, he is alone with his Lord. The brand
plucked from the blaze has soon burned out. But
what does it matter? At its ardent flame a thousand
other torches have been ignited; and the lands
that sat so long in darkness have welcomed the coming
of a wondrous light!

<h2><a name="chapter_viii" id="chapter_viii">VIII</a></h2>

<h3>MICHAEL TREVANION'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Michael Trevanion misunderstood Paul: that
was the trouble. Michael, so Mark Rutherford
tells us, was a Puritan of the Puritans, silent, stern,
unbending. Between his wife and himself no sympathy
existed. They had two children--a boy and
a girl. The girl was in every way her mother's
child: the boy was the image of his father. Michael
made a companion of his son; took him into his own
workshop; and promised himself that, come what
might, Robert should grow up to walk in his father's
footsteps. All went well until Robert Trevanion
met Susan Shipton. Susan was one of the beauties
of that Cornish village. She had--what were not
common in Cornwall--light flaxen hair, blue eyes,
and a rosy face, somewhat inclined to be plump.
The Shiptons lay completely outside Michael's circle.
They were mere formalists in religion, fond of
pleasure; and Susan especially was much given to
gaiety. She went to picnics and dances; rowed herself
about the bay with her friends; and sauntered
round the town with her father and mother on Sunday
afternoons. She was fond of bathing, too, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
was a good swimmer. Michael hardly knew how
to put his objection in words, but he nevertheless
had a horror of women who could swim. It seemed
to him an ungodly accomplishment. He did not
believe for a moment that Paul would have sanctioned
it. That settled it for Michael. For Michael
had unbounded faith in the judgment of Paul; and
the tragedy of his life lay in the fact that, on one
important occasion, he misunderstood his oracle.
</p>

<p>
One summer's morning, Robert saved Susan from
drowning. She had forgotten the swirl of water
caused by the rush of the river into the bay, and
had swum into the danger zone. In three minutes
Robert was at her side, had gripped her by the
bathing dress at the back of her neck, and had
brought her into safer water. From that moment
the two were often together; and, one afternoon,
Michael came suddenly upon them and guessed their
secret. It nearly broke his heart. In Robert's attachment
to Susan he saw--or thought he saw--the
end of all his hopes. 'He remembered what his
own married life had been; he always trusted that
Robert would have a wife who would be a help to
him, and he felt sure that this girl Shipton, with
her pretty face and blue eyes, had no brains. To
think that his boy should repeat the same inexplicable
blunder, that he would never hear from his
wife's lips one serious word! What would she be
if trouble came upon him? She was not a child of
God. He did not know that she ever sought the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Lord. She went to church once a day and read her
prayers, and that was all. She was not one of the
chosen; she might corrupt Robert and he might fall
away and so commit the sin against the Holy Ghost.
He went to his room, and, shutting the door, wept
bitter tears. 'O my son, Absalom,' he cried, 'my
son, my son Absalom! Would God I had died for
thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!'
</p>

<p>
It was in these desperate straits that poor
Michael consulted Paul--and misunderstood him.
It was a Sunday night. Michael picked up the
Bible and turned to the Epistle to the Romans. It
was his favorite epistle. He read the ninth chapter.
The third verse startled him. '<i>I could wish
that myself were accursed from Christ for my
brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh.</i>' Nobody
need wonder that the words strangely affected
him. In his <i>Table Talk</i>, Coleridge says that when
he read this passage to a friend of his, a Jew at
Ramsgate, the old man burst into tears. 'Any Jew
of sensibility,' the poet adds, 'must be deeply impressed
by it.' Michael Trevanion read the throbbing
words again. '<i>I could wish that myself were
accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen
according to the flesh.</i>'
</p>

<p>
He laid down the Book. 'What did Paul mean?
What <i>could</i> he mean save that he was willing to be
damned to save those whom he loved? And why
not? Why should not a man be willing to be
damned for others? Damnation! It is awful, horrible.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Millions of years, with no relief, with no
light from the Most High, and in subjection to
His enemy! "And yet, if it is to save--if it is to
save Robert," thought Michael, "God give me
strength--I could endure it. Did not the Son Himself
venture to risk the wrath of the Father that
He might redeem man? What am I? What is
my poor self?" And Michael determined that night
that neither his life in this world nor in the next, if
he could rescue his child, should be of any account.'
</p>

<p>
So far Michael and Paul were of one mind. Now
for the divergence! Now for the misunderstanding!
Michael questioned himself and his oracle
further. 'What could Paul mean exactly? God
could not curse him <i>if he did no wrong</i>. He could
only mean that he was willing <i>to sin</i>, and be punished,
provided Israel might live. It was lawful
then to <i>tell a lie or perpetrate any evil deed</i> in order
to protect his child.' Michael therefore took his
resolution. He hinted to Robert that Susan's history
was besmirched with shame. He left on his
desk--where he knew Robert would see it--a fragment
of an old letter referring to the downfall of
another girl named Susan. Michael knew that he
was telling and acting a lie, a terrible and unpardonable
lie. He firmly believed that, in telling that
dreadful lie, he was damning his soul to all eternity.
But in damning his own soul--so he thought--he
was saving his son's. And that, after all,
was the lesson that Paul had taught him.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>
The rest of the story does not immediately concern
us. Robert, on seeing the documentary proof
of Susan's shame, ran away from home. Michael,
overwhelmed with wretchedness, attempted to
drown himself in the swirl at the mouth of the
river. Of what value was life to him, now that his
soul was everlastingly lost? He awoke to find himself
on the bank, with Susan bending over him
and kissing him. He soon discovered that there
was more sense in Susan's head, and more grace
in her heart, than he had for one moment imagined.
He set out after his son; found him; and died in
making his great and humiliating confession. He
had meant well, but he had misunderstood. He had
misunderstood Paul.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Michael made two mistakes, and they were grave
and tragic and fatal mistakes.
</p>

<p>
<i>He thought that good fruit could be produced
from an evil tree.</i> There are times when it looks
possible. But it is always an illusion. When I see
Michael Trevanion in the hour of his great temptation,
I wish I could introduce him to Jeanie Deans.
For, in <i>The Heart of Midlothian</i>, Sir Walter Scott
has outlined a very similar situation. Poor Jeanie
was tempted to save her wayward sister by a lie.
It was a very little lie, a mere glossing over of the
truth. The slightest deviation from actual veracity,
and her sister's life, which was dearer to her than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
her own, would be saved from the scaffold, and her
family honor would be vindicated. But Jeanie
could not, and would not, believe that there could
be salvation in a lie. With her gentle heart reproaching
her, but with her conscience applauding
her, she told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth. And then she set out for London.
Along the great white road she trudged, until her
feet were bleeding and her exhausted form could
scarcely drag itself along the dreadful miles. But
on she pressed, until she saw the lights of London
town; and still on, overcoming every barrier, until
she stood before the Queen. And then she pleaded,
as no mere advocate could plead, for Effie. With
what passion, what entreaties, what tears did she besiege
the throne! And, before the tempest of her
grief and eloquence, the Queen yielded completely
and gave her her sister's life. To Jeanie Deans and
to Michael Trevanion there came the same terrible
ordeal; but Jeanie stood where Michael fell. That
was the <i>first</i> of his two mistakes.
</p>

<p>
The <i>second</i> was that <i>he thought that spiritual results
could be engineered</i>. He fancied that souls
could be saved by wire-pulling.
</p>

<p>
'Robert,' he said, on the day of his death and of
his bitter confession, 'Robert, I have sinned, although
it was for the Lord's sake, and He has
rebuked me. I thought to take upon myself the direction
of His affairs; but He is wiser than I. I believed
I was sure of His will, but I was mistaken.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
He knows that what I did, I did for the love of your
soul, my child; but I was grievously wrong.'
</p>

<p>
'The father,' says Mark Rutherford, 'humbled
himself before the son, but in his humiliation became
majestic; and, in after years, when he was dead
and gone, there was no scene in the long intercourse
with him which lived with a brighter and fairer
light in the son's memory.'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
And so Michael Trevanion sinned and suffered
for his sin! For my part, I have no stones to cast
at him. I would rather sit at his feet and learn the
golden lesson of his life. For love--and especially
the love of an earnest man for another's soul--covers
a multitude of sins. There come to all of
us mountain moments, moments in which we stand
on the higher altitudes and catch a glimpse of the
unutterable preciousness of a human soul. But we
are disobedient to the heavenly vision. We are like
Augustine Saint Clare in <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>. He
could never forget, he said, the words with which
his mother impressed upon him the dignity and
worth of the souls of the slaves. Those passionate
sentences of hers seemed to have burnt themselves
into his brain. 'I have looked into her face with
solemn awe,' he told Miss Ophelia, 'when she
pointed to the stars in the evening and said to me,
"See there, Auguste! the poorest, meanest soul on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
our place will be living when all those stars are
gone for ever--will live as long as God lives!" '
</p>

<p>
'Then why don't you free your slaves?' asked
Miss Ophelia, with a woman's practical and incisive
logic.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not equal to that!' Saint Clare replied; and
he confessed that, through having proved recreant
to the ideals that had once so clearly presented
themselves, he was not the man that he might have
been.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not equal to that!' said Augustine Saint
Clare.
</p>

<p>
But Michael Trevanion <i>was</i> equal to that--and
to a great deal more. He saw the value of his son's
soul, and he was willing to be shut out of heaven
for ever and ever if only Robert could be eternally
saved! 'My witness is above,' says Samuel Rutherford,
in his <i>Second Letter to his Parishioners</i>, 'my
witness is above that your heaven would be two
heavens to me, and the salvation of you all as two
salvations to me. I would agree to a suspension
and a postponement of my heaven for many hundreds
of years if ye could so be assured of a lodging
in the Father's house.' Michael Trevanion's behavior--mistaken
as it was--proved that he was
willing to make an even greater sacrifice if, by so
doing, he could compass the salvation of his son.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
It is at this point that Michael Trevanion falls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
into line with the great masters. Since the apostolic
days we have had two conspicuously successful
evangelists--John Wesley and Mr. Spurgeon.
The secret of their success is so obvious that he
who runs may read. I turn to my edition of John
Wesley's <i>Journal</i>, and at the end I find a tribute
like this: 'The great purpose of his life was doing
good. For this he relinquished all honor and preferment;
to this he dedicated all his powers of body
and mind; at all times and in all places, in season
and out of season, by gentleness, by terror, by argument,
by persuasion, by reason, by interest, by
every motive and every inducement, he strove, with
unwearied assiduity, to turn men from the error of
their ways and awaken them to virtue and religion.
To the bed of sickness or the couch of prosperity;
to the prison or the hospital; to the house of mourning
or the house of feasting, wherever there was a
friend to serve or a soul to save, he readily repaired.
He thought no office too humiliating, no
condescension too low, no undertaking too arduous,
to reclaim the meanest of God's offspring. <i>The
souls of all men were equally precious in his sight
and the value of an immortal creature beyond all
estimation.</i>'
</p>

<p>
In relation to Mr. Spurgeon, we cannot do better
than place ourselves under Mr. W. Y. Fullerton's
direction. Mr. Fullerton knew Mr. Spurgeon intimately,
and the standard biography of the great
preacher is from his pen. Mr. Fullerton devotes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a good deal of his space to an inquiry as to the
sources of Mr. Spurgeon's power and authority.
It is an elusive and difficult question. It is admitted
that there is scarcely one respect in which
Mr. Spurgeon's powers were really transcendent.
He had a fine voice; but others had finer ones. He
was eloquent; but others were no less so. He used
to say that his success was due, not to his preaching
of the Gospel, but to the Gospel that he preached.
Obviously, however, this is beside the mark, for he
himself would not have been so uncharitable as to
deny that others preached the same Gospel and yet
met with no corresponding success. The truth
probably is that, although he attained to super-excellence
at no point, he was really great at many.
And, behind this extraordinary combination of remarkable,
though not transcendent, powers was an
intense conviction, a deadly earnestness, a consuming
passion, that made second-rate qualities sublime.
The most revealing paragraph in the book
occurs towards the end. It is a quotation from Mr.
Spurgeon himself. 'Leaving home early in the
morning,' he says, 'I went to the vestry and sat
there all day long, seeing those who had been
brought to Christ by the preaching of the Word.
Their stories were so interesting to me that the
hours flew by without my noticing how fast they
were going. I had seen numbers of persons during
the day, one after the other; and I was so delighted
with the tales of divine mercy they had to tell me,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and the wonders of grace God wrought in them,
that I did not notice how the time passed. At seven
o'clock we had our prayer meeting. I went in to it.
After that came the church meeting. A little before
ten I felt faint, and I began to think at what hour
I had eaten my dinner, and I then for the first time
remembered that <i>I had not had any</i>! I never
thought of it. I never even felt hungry, because
God had made me so glad!' Mr. Spurgeon lived
that he might save men. He thought of nothing
else. From his first sermon at Waterbeach to his
last at Mentone, the conversion of sinners was the
dream of all his days. That master-passion glorified
the whole man, and threw a grandeur about
the common details of every day. He would cheerfully
have thrown away his soul to save the souls
of others.
</p>

<p>
It is along this road that the Church has always
marched to her most splendid triumphs. Why did
the Roman Empire so swiftly capitulate to the
claims of Christ? Lecky discusses that question in
his <i>History of European Morals</i>. And he answers
it by saying that the conquest was achieved by the
new spirit which Christ had introduced. The idea
of a Saviour who could weep at the sepulcher of
His friend; and be touched by a sense of His
people's infirmities, was a novelty to that old pagan
world. And when the early Christians showed
themselves willing to endure any suffering, or bear
any loss, if, by so doing, they might win their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
friends, their sincerity and devotion proved irresistible.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
But Michael Trevanion must lead us higher yet.
For what Michael Trevanion learned from Paul,
Paul himself had learned from an infinitely greater.
Let us trace it back!
</p>

<p>
'Let me be damned to all eternity that my boy
may be saved!' cries Michael Trevanion, sitting at
the feet of Paul, but misunderstanding his teacher.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I could wish that myself were accursed from
Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to
the flesh</i>,' exclaims Paul, sitting at the feet of One
who not only <i>wished</i> to be accursed, but <i>entered into</i>
the impenetrable darkness of that dreadful anathema.
</p>

<p>
'<i>My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?</i>'
He cried from that depth of dereliction. 'In that
awful hour,' said Rabbi Duncan, addressing his
students, 'in that awful hour <i>He took our damnation,
and He took it lovingly!</i>' When, with reverent
hearts and bated breath, we peer down into the
fathomless deeps that such a saying opens to us,
we catch a glimpse of the inexpressible value which
heaven sets upon the souls of men. And, when
Michael Trevanion has led us to such inaccessible
heights and to such unutterable depths as these, we
can very well afford to say Good-bye to him.

<h3>HUDSON TAYLOR'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
The day on which James Hudson Taylor--then a
boy in his teens--found himself confronted by that
tremendous text was, as he himself testified in old
age, 'a day that he could never forget.' It is a day
that China can never forget; a day that the world
can never forget. It was a holiday; everybody was
away from home; and the boy found time hanging
heavily upon his hands. In an aimless way he wandered,
during the afternoon, into his father's library,
and poked about among the shelves. 'I tried,'
he says, 'to find some book with which to while
away the leaden hours. Nothing attracting me, I
turned over a basket of pamphlets and selected from
among them a tract that looked interesting. I knew
that it would have a story at the commencement
and a moral at the close; but I promised myself that
I would enjoy the story and leave the rest. It
would be easy to put away the tract as soon as it
should seem prosy.' He scampers off to the stable-loft,
throws himself on the hay, and plunges into
the book. He is captivated by the narrative, and
finds it impossible to drop the book when the story
comes to an end. He reads on and on. He is rewarded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
by one great golden word whose significance
he has never before discovered: '<i>The Finished Work
of Christ!</i>' The theme entrances him; and at last
he only rises from his bed in the soft hay that he
may kneel on the hard floor of the loft and surrender
his young life to the Saviour who had surrendered
everything for him. If, he asked himself,
as he lay upon the hay, if the whole work was finished,
and the whole debt paid upon the Cross, what
is there left for me to do? 'And then,' he tells us,
'there dawned upon me the joyous conviction that
there was nothing in the world to be done but to fall
upon my knees, accept the Saviour and praise Him
for evermore.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>It is finished!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>When Jesus, therefore, had received the vinegar
he said, "It is finished!" and He bowed His head
and gave up the ghost.</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Then there dawned upon me the joyous conviction
that, since the whole work was finished and the
whole debt paid upon the Cross, there was nothing
for me to do but to fall upon my knees, accept the
Saviour and praise Him for evermore!</i>'
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
'<i>It is finished!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It is really only one word: the greatest word ever
uttered; we must examine it for a moment as a
lapidary examines under a powerful glass a rare
and costly gem.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>
It was a <i>farmer's</i> word. When, into his herd,
there was born an animal so beautiful and shapely
that it seemed absolutely destitute of faults and
defects, the farmer gazed upon the creature with
proud, delighted eyes. '<i>Tetelestai!</i>' he said,
'<i>tetelestai!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It was an <i>artist's</i> word. When the painter or the
sculptor had put the last finishing touches to the
vivid landscape or the marble bust, he would stand
back a few feet to admire his masterpiece, and, seeing
in it nothing that called for correction or improvement,
would murmur fondly, '<i>Tetelestai!
tetelestai!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It was a <i>priestly</i> word. When some devout worshiper,
overflowing with gratitude for mercies
shown him, brought to the temple a lamb without
spot or blemish, the pride of the whole flock, the
priest, more accustomed to seeing the blind and defective
animals led to the altar, would look admiringly
upon the pretty creature. '<i>Tetelestai!</i>' he
would say, '<i>tetelestai!</i>'
</p>

<p>
And when, in the fullness of time, the Lamb of
God offered Himself on the altar of the ages, He
rejoiced with a joy so triumphant that it bore down
all His anguish before it. The sacrifice was stainless,
perfect, finished! '<i>He cried with a loud voice
Tetelestai! and gave up the ghost.</i>'
</p>

<p>
This divine self-satisfaction appears only twice,
once in each Testament. When He completed the
work of Creation, He looked upon it and said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
it was very good; when He completed the work of
Redemption He cried with a loud voice <i>Tetelestai</i>!
It means exactly the same thing.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
The joy of finishing and of finishing well! How
passionately good men have coveted for themselves
that ecstasy! I think of those pathetic entries in
Livingstone's journal. 'Oh, to finish my work!'
he writes again and again. He is haunted by the
vision of the unseen waters, the fountains of the
Nile. Will he live to discover them? 'Oh, to finish!'
he cries; 'if only I could finish my work!' I think
of Henry Buckle, the author of the <i>History of
Civilization</i>. He is overtaken by fever at Nazareth
and dies at Damascus. In his delirium he raves
continually about his book, his still unfinished book.
'Oh, to finish my book!' And with the words 'My
book! my book!' upon his burning lips, his spirit
slips away. I think of Henry Martyn sitting amidst
the delicious and fragrant shades of a Persian garden,
weeping at having to leave the work that he
seemed to have only just begun. I think of Dor&eacute;
taking a sad farewell of his unfinished <i>Vale of
Tears</i>; of Dickens tearing himself from the manuscript
that he knew would never be completed; of
Macaulay looking with wistful and longing eyes
at the <i>History</i> and <i>The Armada</i> that must for ever
stand as 'fragments'; and of a host besides. Life is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
often represented by a broken column in the church-yard.
Men long, but long in vain, for the priceless
privilege of finishing their work.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
The joy of finishing and of finishing well! There
is no joy on earth comparable to this. Who is there
that has not read a dozen times the immortal postscript
that Gibbon added to his <i>Decline and Fall</i>?
He describes the tumult of emotion with which,
after twenty years of closest application, he wrote
the last line of the last chapter of the last volume of
his masterpiece. It was a glorious summer's night
at Lausanne. 'After laying down my pen,' he says,
'I took several turns in a covered walk of acacias
which commands a prospect of the country, the
lake and the mountains. The air was temperate,
the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon was
reflected from the waters, and all nature was silent.'
It was the greatest moment of his life. We recall,
too, the similar experience of Sir Archibald Alison.
'As I approached the closing sentence of my <i>History
of the Empire</i>,' he says, 'I went up to Mrs.
Alison to call her down to witness the conclusion,
and she saw the last words of the work written,
and signed her name on the margin. It would be
affectation to conceal the deep emotion that I felt
at this event.' Or think of the last hours of Venerable
Bede. Living away back in the early dawn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of our English story--twelve centuries ago--the old
man had set himself to translate the Gospel of
John into our native speech. Cuthbert, one of his
young disciples, has bequeathed to us the touching
record. As the work approached completion, he
says, death drew on apace. The aged scholar was
racked with pain; sleep forsook him; he could
scarcely breathe. The young man who wrote at
his dictation implored him to desist. But he would
not rest. They came at length to the final chapter;
could he possibly live till it was done?
</p>

<p>
'And now, dear master,' exclaimed the young
scribe tremblingly, 'only one sentence remains!' He
read the words and the sinking man feebly recited
the English equivalents.
</p>

<p>
'It is finished, dear master!' cried the youth excitedly.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, <i>it is finished</i>!' echoed the dying saint; 'lift
me up, place me at that window of my cell at which
I have so often prayed to God. Now glory be to
the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost!'
And, with these triumphant words, the beautiful
spirit passed to its rest and its reward.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
In his own narrative of his conversion, Hudson
Taylor quotes James Proctor's well-known hymn--the
hymn that, in one of his essays, Froude criticizes
so severely:
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nothing either great or small,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Nothing, sinner, no;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Jesus did it, did it all,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Long, long ago.<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'<i>It is Finished!</i>' yes, indeed,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Finished every jot;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Sinner, this is all you need;<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Tell me, is it not?<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cast your deadly doing down,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Down at Jesus' feet;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Stand in Him, in Him alone,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Gloriously complete.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Froude maintains that these verses are immoral.
It is only by 'doing,' he argues, that the work of
the world can ever get done. And if you describe
'doing' as 'deadly' you set a premium upon indolence
and lessen the probabilities of attainment.
The best answer to Froude's plausible contention is
the <i>Life of Hudson Taylor</i>. Hudson Taylor became
convinced, as a boy, that 'the whole work was
finished and the whole debt paid.' 'There is nothing
for me to do,' he says, 'but to fall down on my
knees and accept the Saviour.' The chapter in his
biography that tells of this spiritual crisis is entitled
'<i>The Finished Work of Christ</i>,' and it is headed
by the quotation:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon a life I did not live,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a death I did not die,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Another's life, Another's death<br/></span>
<span class="i2">I stake my whole eternity.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>
And, as I have said, the very words that Froude
so bitterly condemns are quoted by Hudson Taylor
as a reflection of his own experience. And the
result? The result is that Hudson Taylor became
one of the most prodigious toilers of all time. So
far from his trust in '<i>the Finished Work of Christ</i>'
inclining him to indolence, he felt that he must toil
most terribly to make so perfect a Saviour known
to the whole wide world. There lies on my desk
a Birthday Book which I very highly value. It was
given me at the docks by Mr. Thomas Spurgeon as
I was leaving England. If you open it at the
twenty-first of May you will find these words:
'<i>"Simply to Thy Cross I cling" is but half of the
Gospel. No one is really clinging to the Cross who
is not at the same time faithfully following Christ
and doing whatsoever He commands</i>'; and against
those words of Dr. J. R. Miller's in my Birthday
Book, you may see the autograph of <i>J. Hudson Taylor</i>.
He was our guest at the Mosgiel Manse when
he set his signature to those striking and significant
sentences.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
'<i>We Build Like Giants; we Finish Like Jewelers!</i>'--so
the old Egyptians wrote over the portals of
their palaces and temples. I like to think that the
most gigantic task ever attempted on this planet--the
work of the world's redemption--was finished
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
with a precision and a nicety that no jeweler could
rival.
</p>

<p>
'<i>It is finished!</i>' He cried from the Cross.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Tetelestai! Tetelestai!</i>'
</p>

<p>
When He looked upon His work in Creation and
saw that it was good, He placed it beyond the power
of man to improve upon it.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To gild refin&egrave;d gold, to paint the lily,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">To throw a perfume on the violet,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">To smooth the ice, or add another hue<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light<br/></span>
<span class="i0">To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
And, similarly, when He looked upon His work
in Redemption and cried triumphantly '<i>Tetelestai</i>,'
He placed it beyond the power of any man to add
to it.
</p>

<p>
There are times when any addition is a subtraction.
Some years ago, White House at Washington--the
residence of the American Presidents--was
in the hands of the painters and decorators. Two
large entrance doors had been painted to represent
black walnut. The contractor ordered his men to
scrape and clean them in readiness for repainting,
and they set to work. But when their knives penetrated
to the solid timber, they discovered to their
astonishment that it was heavy mahogany of a most
exquisite natural grain! The work of that earlier
decorator, so far from adding to the beauty of the
timber, had only served to conceal its essential and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
inherent glory. It is easy enough to add to the
wonders of Creation or of Redemption; but you can
never add without subtracting. '<i>It is finished!</i>'
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
Many years ago, Ebenezer Wooton, an earnest
but eccentric evangelist, was conducting a series of
summer evening services on the village green at
Lidford Brook. The last meeting had been held;
the crowd was melting slowly away; and the evangelist was
engaged in taking down the marquee.
All at once a young fellow approached him and
asked, casually rather than earnestly, 'Mr. Wooton,
what must <i>I</i> do to be saved?' The preacher took
the measure of his man.
</p>

<p>
'Too late!' he said, in a matter of fact kind of
way, glancing up from a somewhat obstinate tent-peg
with which he was struggling. 'Too late, my
friend, too late!' The young fellow was startled.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, don't say that, Mr. Wooton!' he pleaded,
a new note coming into his voice. 'Surely it isn't
too late just because the meetings are over?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my friend,' exclaimed the evangelist, dropping
the cord in his hand, straightening himself up,
and looking right into the face of his questioner,
'it's too late! You want to know what you must <i>do</i>
to be saved, and I tell you that you're hundreds of
years too late! The work of salvation is done, completed,
<i>finished</i>! It was finished on the Cross; Jesus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
said so with the last breath that He drew! What
more do you want?'
</p>

<p>
And, then and there, it dawned upon the now
earnest inquirer on the village green as, at about
the same time, it dawned upon young Hudson
Taylor in the hay-loft, that '<i>since the whole work
was finished and the whole debt paid upon the Cross,
there was nothing for him to do but to fall upon his
knees and accept the Saviour</i>.' And there, under
the elms, the sentinel stars witnessing the great
transaction, he kneeled in glad thanksgiving and
rested his soul for time and for eternity on '<i>the Finished
Work of Christ</i>.'
</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>
'<i>The Finished Work of Christ!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Tetelestai! Tetelestai!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>It is finished!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It is not a sigh of relief at having reached the
end of things. It is the unutterable joy of the artist
who, putting the last touches to the picture that has
engrossed him for so long, sees in it the realization
of all his dreams and can nowhere find room for
improvement. Only once in the world's history did
a finishing touch bring a work to absolute perfection;
and on that day of days a single flaw would
have shattered the hope of the ages.

<h3>RODNEY STEELE'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
'As soon,' Dr. Chalmers used to say, 'as soon as a
man comes to understand that <i>GOD IS LOVE</i>, he
is infallibly converted.' Mrs. Florence L. Barclay
wrote a book to show how Rodney Steele made that
momentous and transfiguring discovery. Rodney
Steele--the hero of <i>The Wall of Partition</i>--was a
great traveler and a brilliant author. He had wandered
through India, Africa, Australia, Egypt,
China and Japan, and had written a novel colored
with the local tints of each of the countries he had
visited. He was tall, strong, handsome, bronzed by
many suns, and--largely as a result of his literary
successes--immensely rich. But he was soured.
Years ago he loved a beautiful girl. But an unscrupulous
and designing woman had gained his
sweetheart's confidence and had poisoned her heart
by pouring into her ear the most abominable scandals
concerning him. She had returned his letters;
and he, in the vain hope of being able to forget, had
abandoned himself to travel and to literature. But,
on whatever seas he sailed, and on whatever shores
he wandered, he nursed in his heart a dreadful hate--a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
hate of the woman who had so cruelly intervened.
And, cherishing that hate, his heart became
hard and bitter and sour. He lost faith in love, in
womanhood, in God, in everything. And his books
reflected the cynicism of his soul. This is Rodney
Steele as the story opens. The boat-train moves into
Charing Cross, and, after an absence of ten years,
he finds himself once more in London.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Many years ago, when our grandmothers were
girls, they devoted their spare moments to the making
of bookmarkers; and on the marker, in colored
silk, they embroidered the letters GOD IS LOVE.
Dr. Handley Moule, Bishop of Durham, made effective
use of such a bookmarker when he visited
West Stanley immediately after the terrible colliery
disaster there. He motored up to the scene of the
catastrophe and addressed the crowd at the pit's
mouth. Many of those present were the relatives
of the entombed miners. 'It is very difficult,' he
said, 'for us to understand why God should let such
an awful disaster happen, but we know Him, and
trust Him, and all will be right. I have at home,'
the Bishop continued, 'an old bookmarker given me
by my mother. It is worked in silk, and, when I
examine the wrong side of it, I see nothing but a
tangle of threads crossed and recrossed. It looks
like a big mistake. One would think that someone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
had done it who did not know what she was doing.
But, when I turn it over and look at the right side,
I see there, beautifully embroidered, the letters GOD
IS LOVE. We are looking at all this to-day,' he
concluded, 'from the wrong side. Some day we
shall see it from another standpoint, and shall understand.'
This all happened many years ago; but
quite recently some who were present declared that
they never forgot the story of the bookmarker and
the comfort that it brought.
</p>

<p>
It was a bookmarker of exactly the same kind,
and bearing precisely the same inscription, that
brought the fragrance of roses into the dusty heart
of Rodney Steele. Sitting alone in his Harley Street
flat, he found himself turning over the pages of a
Bible that belonged to Mrs. Jake, his housekeeper.
Among those pages he found Mrs. Jake's marriage
'lines,' a photograph of her husband in military
uniform, some pressed flowers and--a perforated
bookmarker! And on the bookmarker, in pink silk,
were embroidered the words: GOD IS LOVE. It
reminded him of those far-off days in which, as a
little boy, he had delighted in the possession of his
first box of paints. He had begged his mother to
give him something to color, and she had pricked
out those very words on a card and asked him to
paint them for her.
</p>

<p>
<i>God! Love!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Love! God!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>God is Love!</i>
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>
So said the bookmarker; but, he reflected sadly,
<i>love</i> had failed him long ago, and of <i>God</i> he had no
knowledge at all.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
When those three tremendous words next confronted
Rodney Steele, they were worked, not in
silk, but in stone! In a lower flat, in the same building
in Harley Street, there dwelt a Bishop's widow.
Rodney got to know her, to like her, and, at last,
to confide in her. One afternoon they were discussing
the novel that all London was reading, <i>The
Great Divide</i>. It was from his own pen, but he did
not tell her so. Mrs. Bellamy--the widow--confessed
that, in spite of its brilliance, she did not like
it. It betrayed bitterness, a loss of ideals, a disbelief
in love; it was not uplifting.
</p>

<p>
'It is life,' Rodney replied. 'Life tends to make
a man lose faith in love.'
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Bellamy would not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
'May I tell you,' she asked, 'the Bishop's way of
meeting all difficulties, sorrows and perplexities?'
</p>

<p>
'Do tell me,' said Rodney.
</p>

<p>
'He met them with three little words, each of one
syllable. Yet that sentence holds the truth of greatest
import to our poor world; and its right understanding
readjusts our entire outlook upon life,
and should affect all our dealings with our fellow
men: GOD IS LOVE. In our first home--a country
parish in Surrey--three precious children were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
born to us--Griselda, Irene and little Launcelot.
Scarlet fever and diphtheria broke out in the village,
a terrible epidemic, causing grief and anxiety in
many homes. We were almost worn out with helping
our poor people--nursing, consoling, encouraging.
Then, just as the epidemic appeared to be abating,
it reached our own home. Our darlings were
stricken suddenly. Mr. Steele, we lost all three in
a fortnight! My little Lancy was the last to go.
When he died in my arms I felt I could bear no
more.
</p>

<p>
'My husband led me out into the garden. It was
a soft, sweet, summer night. He took me in his
arms and stood long in silence, looking up to the
quiet stars, while I sobbed upon his breast. At last
he said, "My wife, there is one rope to which we
must cling steadfastly, in order to keep our heads
above water amid these overwhelming waves of
sorrow. It has three golden strands. It will not
fail us. GOD--IS--LOVE."
</p>

<p>
'The nursery was empty. There was no more
patter of little feet; no children's merry voices
shouted about the house. The three little graves
in the churchyard bore the names Griselda, Irene
and Launcelot; and on each we put the text, spelt
out by the initials of our darlings' names: GOD
IS LOVE. And in our own heart-life we experienced
the great calm and peace of a faith which had
come through the deepest depths of sorrow. We
were sustained by the certainty of the love of God.'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>
Rodney Steele was deeply touched and impressed.
Here was one who had known sorrow and had
been sweetened by it. In her there was no trace of
bitterness.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know,' he said to himself, as he came
away, 'I don't know as to the truth of the Bishop's
text; but, anyway, the Bishop's widow is love. She
lives what she believes, and that certainly makes a
belief worth having.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is love!</i>'--he had seen it worked in silk.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is love</i>'--he had seen it inscribed three times
in stone.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is love!</i>'--he had seen it translated into
actual life.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is love!</i>'--he was almost persuaded to believe it.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
<i>God is----!</i>
</p>

<p>
It is the oldest question in the universe, and the
greatest. It has been asked a million million times,
and it would not have been altogether strange had
we never discovered an answer. In Mr. H. G. Wells'
story of the men who invaded the moon, he describes
a conversation between the travelers and the Grand
Lunar. The Grand Lunar asks them many questions about
the earth which they are unable to answer.
'What?' he exclaims, 'knowing so little of
<i>the earth</i>, do you attempt to explore <i>the moon</i>?' We
men know little enough of <i>ourselves</i>: it would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
been no cause for astonishment had we been unable
to define <i>God</i>. Men lost themselves for ages in
guess-work. They looked round about them; they
saw how grandly a million worlds revolve, and they
noticed how exquisitely the mighty forces of the
earth are governed. Then they made their guess.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is Power</i>,' they said, '<i>God is Power!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Then, peering a little more deeply into the heart
of things, they saw that all these terrific forces are
not only controlled, but harnessed to high ends. All
things are working--they are working together--they
are working together for good! And thereupon
men made their second guess.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is Wisdom</i>,' they said, '<i>God is Wisdom!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Then, observing things still more closely, men
began to see great ethical principles underlying the
laws of the universe. In the long run, evil suffers,
and, in the long run, right is rewarded.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is Justice</i>,' they said, '<i>God is Justice!</i>'
</p>

<p>
And so men made their guesses, and, as they
guessed, they built. They erected temples, now to
the God of Power, then to the God of Wisdom, and
again to the God of Justice. They had yet to learn
that they were worshiping the part and not the
whole; they were worshiping the rays and not the
Light Itself.
</p>

<p>
Then Jesus came, and men understood. By His
words and His deeds, by His life and His death,
He revealed the whole truth. God is Power and
Wisdom and Justice--but He is more. In a European
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
churchyard there stands a monument erected
by a poet to his wife. It bears the inscription:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She was----,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">But words are wanting to say what!<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Think what a wife should be<br/></span>
<span class="i2">And she was that!<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>God is----!</i><br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>God is--what?</i><br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He is----,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">But words are wanting to say what!<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Think what a God should be<br/></span>
<span class="i2">And He is that!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Jesus filled in the age-long blank; He filled it in,
not in cold language, but in warm life. Many attempts
have been made to translate His definition
from the terms of life into the terms of language.
Only once have those attempts been even approximately
successful. The words on the perforated
bookmarker represent the best answer that human
speech has ever given to the question.
</p>

<p>
<i>God is----</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>God is--what?</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>GOD--IS--LOVE!</i>
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
Rodney Steele met again the girl--ripened now
into the full glory of womanhood--from whom he
had been so cruelly separated. He felt that it was
too late to right the earlier wrong; and, in any case,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
his life was too embittered to offer her now. But
he rejoiced in her friendship, and, one day, opened
his heart to her.
</p>

<p>
'Madge,' he said, 'I am furious with Fate. Life is
chaos. Shall I tell you of what it reminds me?
When I was last in Florence I was invited to the
dress rehearsal of "Figli Di Re." I took my seat
in the stalls of the huge empty opera house. The
members of the orchestra were all in their places.
Pandemonium reigned! Each man was playing
little snatches of the score before him, all in the
same key, but with no attempt at time, tune or order.
The piping of the flute, the sighing of the fiddle, the
grunt of the double bass, the clear call of the cornet,
the bray of the trombones, all went on together.
The confused hubbub of sound was indescribable.
Suddenly a slim, alert figure leaped upon the estrade
and struck the desk sharply with a baton. It was the
maestro! There was instant silence. He looked
to the right; looked to the left; raised his baton;
and lo! full, rich, sweet, melodious, blending in perfect
harmony, sounded the opening chords of the
overture!'
</p>

<p>
Rodney likened the jangling discords to the confusion
of his own life. There was in his soul a disappointed
love, an implacable hate, and a medley
of other discords.
</p>

<p>
'You are waiting for the Maestro, Roddie!' said
Madge. 'His baton will reduce chaos to order with
<i>a measure of three beats</i>.'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>
'Three beats?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; three almighty beats: GOD--IS--LOVE!'
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'I left off pricking texts when I was five, and gave
up painting when I was nine.'
</p>

<p>
'It is not what you do to the texts, Rodney; it
is what the texts do to you!'
</p>

<p>
He left her, and, soon after, left London.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Yes, he left her, and he left London; but he could
not leave the text. It confronted him once more.
He had taken refuge in a little fishing village on
the East Coast. Up on the cliffs, among the corn-fields,
flecked with their crimson poppies, he came
upon a quaint old church. He stepped inside. In
the porch was a painting of an old ruin--ivy-covered,
useless and desolate--standing out, jagged and
roofless, against a purple sky. The picture bore a
striking inscription:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ruins of my soul repair<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And make my heart a house of prayer.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
'<i>The ruins of my soul!</i>' Rodney thought of the
discord within.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Make my heart a house of prayer!</i>' Rodney
thought of the maestro.
</p>

<p>
He passed out into the little graveyard on the
very edge of the cliff. He was amused at the quaint
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
epitaphs. Then one tombstone, lying flat upon the
ground, a tombstone which, in large capitals, called
upon the reader to 'Prepare to meet thy God,'
startled him. Again he thought of the clashing discords
of his soul.
</p>

<p>
'Then, suddenly,' says Mrs. Barclay, 'the inspired
Word did that which It--and It alone--can do.
It gripped Rodney and brought him face to face
with realities--past, present and future--in his own
inner life. At once, the Bishop's motto came into
his mind; the three words his gentle mother used to
draw that her little boy might paint them stood out
clearly as the answer to all vague and restless questionings:
GOD IS LOVE!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>God is Love!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Prepare to Meet thy God!</i>'
</p>

<p>
How could he, with his old hate in his heart,
stand in the presence of a God of Love?
</p>

<p>
Standing there bareheaded, with one foot on the
prone tombstone, Rodney grappled with the passion
that he had cherished through the years, and thus
took his first step along the path of preparation.
</p>

<p>
'I forgive the woman who came between us,' he
said aloud. 'My God, I forgive her--as I hope to
be forgiven!'
</p>

<p>
'As soon as a man comes to understand that
<i>GOD IS LOVE</i>,' said Dr. Chalmers, 'he is infallibly
converted.' That being so, Rodney Steele was infallibly
converted that day, and that day he entered
into peace.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
When Robert Louis Stevenson settled at Samoa,
the islands were ablaze with tumult and strife. And,
during those years of bitterness, Stevenson did his
utmost to bring the painful struggle to an end. He
visited the chiefs in prison, lavished his kindnesses
upon the islanders, and made himself the friend of
all. In the course of time the natives became devotedly
attached to the frail and delicate foreigner
who looked as though the first gust of wind would
blow him away. His health required that he should
live away on the hill-top, and they pitied him as he
painfully toiled up the stony slope. To show their
affection for him, they built a road right up to his
house, in order to make the steep ascent more easy.
And they called that road Ala Loto Alofa--<i>The
Road to the Loving Heart</i>. They felt, as they toiled
at their labor of gratitude, that they were not only
conferring a boon on the white man, but that they
were making a beaten path from their own doors
to the heart that loved them all.
</p>

<p>
<i>God is Love</i>; and it is the glory of the everlasting
Gospel that it points the road by which the Father's
wayward sons--in whichever of the far countries
they may have wandered--may find a way back to
the Father's house, and home to the Loving Heart.

<h3>THOMAS HUXLEY'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
She was a sermon-taster and was extremely sensitive
to any kind of heresy. It is in his <i>Life of
Donald John Martin</i>, a Presbyterian minister, that
the Rev. Norman C. Macfarlane places her notable
achievement on permanent record. He describes her
as 'a stern lady who was provokingly evangelical.'
There came to the pulpit one Sabbath a minister
whose soundness she doubted. He gave out as his
text the words: '<i>What doth the Lord require of
thee but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God?</i>' '<i>Weel, weel</i>,' this excellent
woman exclaimed, as she turned to her friend beside
her, '<i>weel, weel, if there's one text in a' the Buik
waur than anither, yon man is sure to tak' it!</i>'
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
She thought that text the <i>worst</i> in the Bible.
Huxley thought it the <i>best</i>. Huxley was, as everybody
knows, the Prince of Agnostics. We need not
stop to ask why. Nobody who has read the story
of John Stuart Mill's boyhood will wonder that Mill
was a skeptic. And nobody who has read the story
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of Thomas Huxley's boyhood will wonder at his
becoming an agnostic. As Edward Clodd, his biographer,
says, 'his boyhood was a cheerless time. Reversing
Matthew Arnold's sunnier memories:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No rigorous teachers seized his youth,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And purged its faith and tried its fire,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Shewed him the high, white star of truth,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">There bade him gaze, and there aspire.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
'He told Charles Kingsley that he was "kicked
into the world, a boy without guide or training, or
with worse than none"; he "had two years of a
pandemonium of a school, and, after that, neither
help nor sympathy in any intellectual direction till
he reached manhood."' And, even then, as those
familiar with his biography know, he had little
enough.
</p>

<p>
What would Huxley have been, I wonder, if the
sympathy for which he hungered had been extended
to him? If, instead of badgering him with
arguments and entangling him in controversy, Mr.
Gladstone and Bishop Wilberforce and others had
honestly attempted to see things through his spectacles!
Huxley was said to be as cold as ice and
as inflexible as steel; but I doubt it. In his life-story
I find two incidents--one belonging to his
early manhood and one belonging to his age--which
tell a very different tale.
</p>

<p>
The <i>first</i> is connected with the birth of his boy.
It is the last night of the Old Year, and he is waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to hear that he is a father. He spends the
anxious hour in framing a resolution. In his diary
he pledges himself 'to smite all humbugs, however
big; to give a nobler tone to science; to set an example
of abstinence from petty personal controversies and
of toleration for everything but lying; to
be indifferent as to whether the work is recognized
as mine or not, so long as it is done. It is half-past
ten at night. Waiting for my child. I seem to fancy
it the pledge that all these things shall be.' And the
next entry runs:
</p>

<p>
'<i>New Year's Day, 1859.</i> Born five minutes before
twelve. Thank God!'
</p>

<p>
Mark that '<i>Thank God!</i>' and then note what follows.
A year or two later, when the child is
snatched from him, he makes this entry and then
closes the journal for ever. He has no heart to
keep a diary afterwards.
</p>

<p>
'Our Noel, our firstborn, after being for nearly
four years our delight and our joy, was carried off
by scarlet fever in forty-eight hours. This day week
he and I had a great romp together. On Friday his
restless head, with its bright blue eyes and tangled
golden hair, tossed all day upon the pillow. On
Saturday night I carried his cold, still body here
into my study. Here, too, on Sunday night, came
his mother and I to that holy leavetaking. My boy
is gone; but in a higher and better sense than was
in my mind when, four years ago, I wrote what
stands above, I feel that my fancy has been fulfilled.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
I say heartily and without bitterness--Amen, so
let it be!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Thank God!</i>' exclaims our great Agnostic when
the child is born.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Amen!</i>' he says, submissively, when the little one
is buried.
</p>

<p>
This is the <i>first</i> of the two incidents. The <i>second</i>--which
is no less pathetic--is recorded by Dr.
Douglas Adam. 'A friend of mine,' the doctor says,
'was acting on a Royal Commission of which Professor
Huxley was a member, and one Sunday they
were staying together in a little country town. "I
suppose you are going to church," said Huxley.
"Yes," replied my friend. "What if, instead, you
stayed at home and talked to me of religion?" "No,"
was the reply, "for I am not clever enough to refute
your arguments." "But what if you simply told me
your own experience--what religion has done for
you?" My friend did not go to church that morning;
he stayed at home and told Huxley the story
of all that Christ had been to him; and presently
there were tears in the eyes of the great agnostic
as he said, "<i>I would give my right hand if I could
believe that!</i>"'
</p>

<p>
This, if you please, is the man who was supposed
to be as cold as ice and as inflexible as steel! This
is the man for whom the Christians of his time had
nothing better than harsh judgments, freezing sarcasms
and windy arguments! How little we know
of each other! How slow we are to understand!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
But the text! It was in the course of his famous--and
furious--controversy with Mr. Gladstone
that Huxley paid his homage to the text. He was
pleading for a better understanding between Religion
and Science.
</p>

<p>
'The antagonism between the two,' he said, 'appears to
me to be purely fictitious. It is fabricated,
on the one hand, by short-sighted religious people,
and, on the other hand, by short-sighted scientific
people.' And he declared that, whatever differences
may arise between the <i>exponents</i> of Nature and the
<i>exponents</i> of the Bible, there can never be any real
antagonism between Science and Religion themselves.
'In the eighth century before Christ,' he
goes on to say, 'in the eighth century before Christ,
in the heart of a world of idolatrous polytheists, the
Hebrew prophets put forth a conception of religion
which appears to me to be as wonderful an inspiration
of genius as the art of Pheidias or the science
of Aristotle. "<i>What doth the Lord require of thee
but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly
with thy God?</i>" If any so-called religion takes
away from this great saying of Micah, I think it
wantonly mutilates, while if it adds thereto, I think
it obscures, the perfect ideal of religion.'
</p>

<p>
And it was on the ground of their common admiration
for this text--the <i>worst</i> text in the world,
the <i>best</i> text in the world--that Mr. Gladstone and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Professor Huxley reached some kind of agreement.
Not to be outdone by his antagonist, Mr. Gladstone
raised his hat to the text.
</p>

<p>
'I will not dispute,' he says, 'that in these words
is contained the true ideal of discipline and attainment.
Still, I cannot help being struck with an
impression that Mr. Huxley appears to cite these
terms of Micah as if they reduced the work of religion
from a difficult to an easy program. But
look at them again. Examine them well. They are,
in truth, in Cowper's words:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Higher than the heights above,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Deeper than the depths beneath.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
<i>Do justly</i>, that is to say, extinguish self; <i>love mercy</i>,
cut utterly away all the pride and wrath and all the
cupidity that make this fair world a wilderness;
<i>walk humbly with thy God</i>, take his will and set it
in the place where thine own was wont to rule.
Pluck down the tyrant from his place; set up the true
Master on His lawful throne.' In the text--the
<i>worst</i> text in the Bible; the <i>best</i> text in the Bible--Mr.
Gladstone and Professor Huxley find a trysting-place.
We may therefore leave the argument at
that point.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
The words with which Huxley fell in love were
addressed by the prophet to a desperate man--and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
that man a king--who was prepared to pay any
price and make any sacrifice if only, by so doing,
he might win for himself the favor of the Most
High. '<i>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord
and bow myself before the high God?' he cries.
'Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with
calves a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with
thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers
of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression,
the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>My firstborn!</i>'--we have just witnessed a father's
anguish on the death of his firstborn. But Balak,
King of Moab, is prepared to lead his firstborn to
the sacrificial altar if, by so doing, he can secure the
favor of the Highest.
</p>

<p>
And the answer of the prophet is that the love of
God is not for sale. And, if it <i>were</i> for sale, it
could not be purchased by an act of immolation in
which heaven could find no pleasure at all. F. D.
Maurice points out, in one of his letters to R. H.
Hutton, that the world has cherished two ideas of
sacrifice. When a man discovers that his life is
out of harmony with the divine Will, he may make
a sacrifice by which he brings his conduct into line
with the heavenly ideal. That is the one view. The
other is Balak's. Balak hopes, by offering his child
upon the altar, to bring the divine pleasure into line
with his unaltered life. 'All light is in the one idea
of sacrifice,' says Maurice, 'and all darkness in the
other. The idea of sacrifice, not as an act of obedience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to the divine will, but as a means of changing
that will, is the germ of every dark superstition.'
</p>

<p>
Heaven is not to be bought, the prophet told the
king. '<i>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good;
and what does the Lord require of thee but to do
justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with
thy God?</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>Equity! Charity! Piety!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Do something! Love something! Be something!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Do justly! Love mercy! Walk humbly with
thy God!</i>
</p>

<p>
These, and these alone, are the offerings in which
heaven finds delight.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
I cannot help feeling sorry for the lady in the
Scottish church. She thinks that Balaam's brave
reply to Balak is the worst text in the Bible. And
she is not alone. For, in his <i>Literature and Dogma</i>,
Matthew Arnold shows that she is the representative
of a numerous and powerful class. 'In our
railway stations are hung up,' Matthew Arnold
says, 'sheets of Bible texts to catch the eye of the
passer-by. And very profitable admonitions to him
they generally are. One, particularly, we have all
seen. It asks the prophet Micah's question: <i>Wherewith
shall I come before the Lord and bow myself
before the high God?</i> And it answers that question
with one short quotation from the New Testament:
<i>With the precious blood of Christ.</i>' Matthew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Arnold maintains that this is not honest. By casting
aside the prophet's answer, and substituting another,
the people who arranged the placard ally
themselves with the lady in the Scottish church.
They evidently think Balaam's reply to Balak <i>the
worst text in the Bible</i>. But is it? Is it good, is it
fair, is it honest to strike out the real answer and
to insert in its place an adopted one? I wish to
ask the lady in the Scottish church--and the people
who prepared the placard--two pertinent questions.
</p>

<p>
My <i>first</i> question is this. Is the deleted text--the
worst text in the Bible--true? That is extremely
important. <i>Does</i> God require that man
should do justly, love mercy and walk humbly with
Himself? Is it not a fact that heaven <i>does</i> insist
on equity and charity and piety? Can there, indeed,
be any true religion without these things? Do they
not represent the irreducible minimum? If this be
so, is it not as well for that Scottish minister to
preach on that terrible text, after all? And, if this
be so, would not the original answer to the question
be the best answer for the placard?
</p>

<p>
My <i>second</i> question is this. Even from the
standpoint of 'a stern lady who is provokingly evangelical,'
is it not well for the minister to preach on
that objectionable text? The lady is anxious, and
commendably anxious, that the pulpit of her church
should sound forth the magnificent verities of the
Christian evangel. But will a man desire the salvation
which the New Testament reveals unless he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
has first recognized his inability to meet heaven's
just demands? In a notable fragment of autobiography,
Paul declares that, but for the law, he would
never have known the meaning of sin. It was when
he heard how much he owed to the divine justice
that he discovered the hopelessness of his bankruptcy.
It was when he listened to the <i>Thou shalts</i>
and the <i>Thou shalt nots</i> that he cried, 'O wretched
man that I am: who shall deliver me?' It was Sinai
that drove him to Calvary. The law, with its stern,
imperative demands, was, he says, the schoolmaster
that led him to Christ. The best way of showing
that a stick is crooked is to lay a straight one beside
it. This being so, the lady in the Scottish
church, and the compilers of Matthew Arnold's
placard, must consider whether, in the interests of
that very evangelism for which they are so justly
jealous, they can afford to supersede the stately
passages that make men feel their desperate need
of a Saviour.
</p>

<p>
This, at any rate, is the way in which Micah
used the story of the conversation between Balak
and Balaam. By means of it he sought to reduce the
people to despair. And then, when they had fallen
upon their faces and covered themselves with sackcloth,
he made one of the noblest evangelical pronouncements
that the Old Testament contains: '<i>He
pardoneth iniquity because He delighteth in mercy:
Thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the
sea</i>.' But the people would never have listened hungrily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
to that glad golden word unless they had first
realized the sublimity of the divine demand and the
incalculable extent of their shortcoming.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
We each have a blind spot. We see truth fragmentarily.
If only the excellent lady in the Scottish
church could have seen, in the minister's text,
what Huxley saw in it! But she didn't; and, because
she was blind to its beauty, she called it '<i>the
worst text in the Bible!</i>' And if only Huxley could
have grasped those precious truths that were so dear
to her! But he never did. He could only shake his
fine head sadly and say, 'I do not know!' 'I would
give my right hand,' he exclaims, 'if I could believe
that!' Mr. Clodd adorns the title-page of his <i>Life
of Huxley</i> with the words of Matthew Arnold: 'He
saw life steadily and saw it whole.' That sad shake
of the head, and that passionate but melancholy
exclamation about giving his right hand, prove that
the tribute is not quite true. Huxley, as he himself
more than half suspected, missed the best.
</p>

<p>
When Sir George Adam Smith, in his <i>Book of
the Twelve Prophets</i>, comes to this great passage
in Micah, he prints it in italics right across the page:
</p>

<p>
<i>What doth the Lord require of thee but to do
justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with
thy God?</i>
</p>

<p>
This, says Sir George, is the greatest saying of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the Old Testament; and there is only one other in
the New which excels it:
</p>

<p>
<i>Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.</i>
</p>

<p>
Huxley had eyes for the <i>first</i>, but none for the
<i>second</i>; the Scottish lady had eyes for the <i>second</i>,
but none for the <i>first</i>; but they who 'see life steadily
and see it whole' will stand up to salute the majesty
of both.
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
It is customary for the Presidents of the United
States to select the passage which they shall kiss
in taking the oath on assuming the responsibilities
of their great office. President Harding had no
hesitation in making his choice. He turned to this
great saying of Micah. '<i>What doth the Lord require
of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and
to walk humbly with thy God?</i>' The lady in the Scottish
church would frown and shake her head, but
the President felt that, of all the texts in the Bible,
<i>that was the best</i>.

<h3>WALTER PETHERICK'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
He was born at Islington on the day on which Sir
Walter Raleigh was executed; and his father named
him after the gallant knight whom he himself was
so proud of having served. That was forty-seven
years ago. He is now a prosperous London merchant,
living, at ordinary times, over his warehouse,
and delighting in the society of his four motherless
children. At ordinary times! But these are not
ordinary times. The plague is in the city! It appeared
for the first time about two months ago and
has gradually increased in virulence ever since. Mr.
Petherick has therefore withdrawn with his two
boys and his two girls to Twickenham. This morning--the
morning of July 16, 1665--they all go
together to the Parish Church. The riverside is in
all its summer glory. The brilliant sunshine seems
to mock both the wretchedness so near at hand and
the heavy anxiety that weighs upon their hearts.
During the week a solemn fast-day has been observed,
and to-day, services of humiliation and intercession
are to be held in all the churches. Several
times, during the past week or two, Mr. Petherick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
has visited the city. It was a melancholy experience.
Most of the shops were shut; poor creatures who
claimed that they themselves or their relatives were
infected by the pestilence cried for alms at every
corner; and he had passed many houses on whose
doors a red cross had been marked, and, underneath,
the words, 'Lord, have mercy upon us!' To-day
that pathetic entreaty is to be offered in every sanctuary.
All through the country, men and women
are pleading that the awful visitation may be stayed.
At Twickenham the church soon fills, and the fervently
murmured responses give evidence of the
depth and intensity of the universal emotion. Mr.
Petherick never forgot the sermon that was preached
in the old church that July morning. At least, he
never forgot the text. '<i>Although the fig tree shall
not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the
labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield
no meat; the flocks shall be cut off from the fold,
and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will rejoice
in the Lord and I will joy in the God of my
salvation!</i>'
</p>

<p>
<i>The fields barren! The stalls empty! The vineyards
bare!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>I will rejoice! I will joy! I will joy! I will rejoice!</i>
</p>

<p>
The text reminded the Pethericks of the dazzling
sunshine that, as they came along, had seemed so
unsympathetic. For here was a radiance equally incongruous!
Here was faith shining like a solitary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
star on a dark night! Here was joy, singing her
song, like the nightingale, amidst the deepest gloom!
It was as though a merry peal of bells was being
rung on a day of public lamentation.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
'The words took hold upon me mightily!' wrote
Walter Petherick to a friend in 1682. I do not
wonder. Quite apart from their singular application
to his own case, they are full of nobility and
grandeur. When, in 1782--exactly a century later--Benjamin
Franklin was appointed American
Plenipotentiary at Paris, some of the brilliant
French wits of that period twitted him on his admiration
for the Bible. He determined to test
their knowledge of the Volume they professed to
scorn. Entering their company one evening, he
told them that he had been reading an ancient poem,
and that its stately beauty had greatly impressed
him. At their request he took from his pocket a
manuscript and proceeded to read it. It was received
with exclamations of extravagant admiration.
'Superb!' they cried. 'Who was the author?
Where did Franklin discover it? How could copies
be obtained?' He informed them, to their astonishment,
that it was the third chapter of the
prophecy of Habakkuk--the passage to which Mr.
Petherick and his children listened that sad but
sunny morning at Twickenham.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>
The Petherick incident belongs to the <i>seventeenth</i>
century; the Franklin incident belongs to the <i>eighteenth</i>;
and they remind me of one that belongs to
the <i>nineteenth</i>. Daniel Webster was one morning
discussing with a number of eminent artists the subjects
commonly chosen for portrayal upon canvas.
'I have often wondered,' he said, 'that no painter
has yet thought it worth his while to draw his inspiration
from one of the most sublime passages in
any literature.' 'And what is that?' they asked.
'Well,' he replied, 'what finer conception for a masterpiece
could any artist desire than the picture of
the prophet Habakkuk sitting in the midst of utter
ruin and desolation, singing, in spite of everything,
faith's joyous and triumphant song?'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
<i>Suppose!</i>
</p>

<p>
It is a <i>Song of Suppositions</i>!
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the fig tree shall not blossom!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the vine shall bear no fruit!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the labor of the olive shall fail!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the fields shall yield no corn!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the flock shall be cut off from the fold!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> there shall be no herd in the stalls!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose! Suppose! Suppose!</i>'
</p>

<p>
I very well remember a conversation I once had
at Mosgiel with old Jeanie McNab. Jeanie subsisted
on a mixed diet of smiles and songs.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>
'But, supposing, Jeanie----' I began one day.
</p>

<p>
'Now don't you have anything to do with <i>supposings</i>,'
she exclaimed. 'I know them all. "<i>Suppose</i>
I should lose my money!" "<i>Suppose</i> I should
lose my health!" And all the rest. When those
<i>supposings</i> come knocking at your heart, you just
slam the door, and bolt it, and don't let any of
them in!'
</p>

<p>
It was excellent advice; yet the prophet acted on
a diametrically opposite principle. When the <i>supposings</i>
came knocking at his door, he cried 'Come
in!' and in they came!
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the figs are barren!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the vines wither!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the olive fail!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the corn perish!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the sheep starve!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Suppose</i> the cattle die!'
</p>

<p>
The prophet invites them all to come in. They
jostle each other as they throng his little room. He
hears all that they have to say, and then he answers
them.
</p>

<p>
'Whence came all these things?' he demands.
'Whence came the figs and the vines and the
olives, the corn and the flocks and the herds?' And,
having asked this question, he himself proceeds to
answer it.
</p>

<p>
'<i>HE</i> gave them!' he cries triumphantly, '<i>HE</i>
gave them! And if they perish, as you <i>suppose</i>, <i>He</i>
can as easily replace them! <i>Therefore will I rejoice</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
<i>in the Lord and will joy in the God of my salvation!</i>
It is a small thing to lose the <i>gifts</i> as long as you
possess the <i>Giver</i>; the supreme tragedy lies in losing
the <i>Giver</i> and retaining only the <i>gifts</i>!'
</p>

<p>
There is no record as to what the preacher said
that Sunday morning at Twickenham; but some
such thoughts as these must have been suggested to
the eager minds of the Pethericks as they listened
so attentively. 'The words took hold upon me
mightily!' the father confessed, in a letter to a
friend, long afterwards.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
That evening a horror of great darkness fell upon
the soul of Walter Petherick. He spent the sunset
hours quietly with the young people, and, before
they bade each other good-night, he read with them
again the passage that had so impressed them in
the morning. Then, left to himself, Mr. Petherick
put on his hat and took a stroll in the lane. It was
a perfect summer's evening, warm and star-lit; yet
its peace failed to penetrate his tortured soul. A
glow-worm twinkled in the grass under the hedge,
but no ray of light pierced the impenetrable gloom
within. He returned to his room, and, after sitting
for a while at the open window, looking down on
the sluggish waters of the tranquil river, he threw
himself on his knees beside his bed. One by one he
prayed for each of his children. The red cross that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
he had seen on so many doors seemed to have
stamped itself upon the retina of his eye; it blazed
before him even whilst the lids were closed in
prayer.
</p>

<p>
'Lord, have mercy on us!' said the legend under
the cross.
</p>

<p>
'Lord, have mercy on us!' cried Mr. Petherick
over and over and over again.
</p>

<p>
He thought of the morning's text, but it only
mocked him, as the sunshine mocked him on his
way to church.
</p>

<p>
'I could not say it,' he moaned. 'If my children
were snatched from me--my fine boys and my lovely
girls--the treasures that <i>she</i> left me--how could I
<i>rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation</i>?'
</p>

<p>
He broke into a fresh outburst of supplication.
Again he mentioned each of his children by name.
'Spare him; oh, spare him!' he cried; and, as he
thought of the girls, 'Spare her, O Lord; have pity,
I beseech Thee!'
</p>

<p>
He wiped his face; it was damp with perspiration.
He allowed his forehead to rest upon his folded
arms; and then, bowed there in the solitude of his
room and in the stillness of the summer night, a
strange thought took possession of him.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
He remembered to have prayed as fervently as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
this before--many, many years ago. In those days--the
days of his earliest religious experiences--he
had prayed, almost as earnestly as this, for his
own spiritual prosperity, for the extension of
Christ's Kingdom and for the enlightenment of the
world. It seemed like a dream as he recalled it.
He was scarcely more than a boy in those days.
The ardor and intensity of that distant time had
deserted him so gradually, and had vanished so
imperceptibly, that he had never missed it until
now. Love had come into his life, irradiating and
transfiguring everything. Love had led to marriage;
four happy children had brought added gladness
to his home and fresh contentment to his heart;
and he had abandoned himself without reserve to
these domestic cares and comforts. The things
that had so completely captivated his soul were all
of them <i>good</i> things--just as the fig and the vine
and the olive, the corn and the flocks and the herds
were all of them <i>good</i> things--but he had allowed
them to elbow out the wealthiest things of all. The
<i>good</i> had become the enemy of the <i>best</i>. Before
his heart had been gladdened by those treasures
that were now so dear to him, he had every day
<i>rejoiced in the Lord and joyed in the God of his
salvation</i>. But not since! His enrichment had
proved his impoverishment! What was it that the
preacher had said? 'It is a small thing to love the
<i>gifts</i> as long as you possess the <i>Giver</i>; the supreme
tragedy lies in losing the <i>Giver</i> and retaining only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the <i>gifts</i>.' And Walter Petherick felt that night
that that supreme tragedy was his.
</p>

<p>
He rose from his knees, reached for his Bible,
and turned once more to the chapter from which
the minister had preached. '<i>O Lord</i>,' it began,
'<i>revive Thy work in the midst of years!</i>' He himself
was '<i>in the midst of years</i>.' The thought
brought with it a sense of shame and a rush of
thankfulness. He was <i>ashamed</i> that he had permitted
the years that had gone to filch so much
from him. Like waves that strew treasures on the
shore, and snatch treasures from the shore, he felt
that the years had brought much and taken much.
Yet he felt grateful that he was still '<i>in the midst of
the years</i>'; it is better to discover life's loss at the
halfway house than to find it out at the end of the
journey! He returned the Bible to its place, and,
as he did so, he closed his eyes and repeated for
himself the prophet's prayer.
</p>

<p>
'<i>O Lord</i>,' he cried, '<i>revive Thy work in the midst
of the years; in the midst of the years make known;
in wrath remember mercy!</i>'
</p>

<p>
It seemed as if the prayer had opened the gates
of his soul to the peace of the night. As he looked
again at the glistening river, he felt strangely
soothed and comforted. And, half an hour later,
he was sleeping as restfully as any of his children.
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Once more it is a Sunday evening, and once more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
we are at Twickenham. For at Twickenham the
family have now made their home; they never,
after the Plague Year, resided in the city. More
than twelve months have passed. We last saw
them on July 16, 1665; this is Sunday, September 2,
1666. And this Sunday has been as eventful and
as memorable as that. For, just as the family were
assembling at the breakfast table, Henry, the elder
of the two boys, burst into the room, exclaiming
excitedly:
</p>

<p>
'Father, the city is on fire!'
</p>

<p>
It was true! London was one great sea of flame!
In the afternoon the father and the two sons drove
as far as the Borough; it was as near as they could
get to the raging conflagration. And what a sight
confronted them! Immense tongues of crimson shot
up from the burning city and seemed to lick the very
skies. When the clouds of smoke parted for a
moment, they saw towers falling, walls collapsing,
chimneys tottering, whilst the crash of roof after
roof kept up a series of reports that resembled the
firing of artillery. Every now and again a terrific
explosion rent the air, followed immediately
by an eruption of flaming debris that looked volcanic
in its weird grandeur. London seemed to be
in the grip of an angry demon that was bent on
tearing it to fragments. The fire exhibited a thousand
fantastic forms; it blazed in every conceivable
hue and color; it roared and shrieked and sputtered;
it hissed and thundered and growled. A spectacle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
of such vivid beauty, yet of such awful horror, had
never been seen in England before. And, somewhere
within the area swept by that red, red ocean
of flame, was Mr. Petherick's warehouse containing
all, or practically all, his earthly possessions!
</p>

<p>
But that Sunday night the soul of Walter Petherick
knew no such anguish as it had known a year
ago. He thought of the '<i>supposes</i>.' He read once
more the prophet's song of defiance and of triumph.
He smiled to himself as he reflected that the flames
could only take the <i>gifts</i>; they could not rob him
of the <i>Giver</i>. '<i>Therefore</i>,' he said to himself, '<i>I will
rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation</i>';
for 'it is a small thing to lose the <i>gifts</i> as long
as you possess the <i>Giver</i>; the supreme tragedy lies
in losing the <i>Giver</i> and retaining only the <i>gifts</i>!'
And that Sunday night, whilst London crackled and
blazed, the sleep of Walter Petherick was once more
like the sleep of a little child.
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
Again it is a Sunday evening at Twickenham.
Walter Petherick has been celebrating his fiftieth
birthday. Three years have passed since the Great
Plague and two since the Great Fire. In the presence
of the young people, he has poured out his
heart in reverent gratitude for the mercies that
have so richly crowned his days. And now, the soft
autumn day, with its russet tints and its misty sunlight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
having closed, he is once more alone in his
room.
</p>

<p>
'O Lord,' he prays, 'Thou hast been pleased by
pestilence and by fire to redeem my soul from destruction.
Thou didst threaten me with the loss
of Thy choicest <i>gifts</i> that I might set my heart's
affections once more upon their <i>Giver</i>. But the fig
tree did not wither; the vines did not perish; the
olive did not fail. The pestilence did not touch
my children; the flames did not destroy my goods.
Accept the thanks of Thy servant this day and
help him, all his days, <i>to rejoice in the Lord and to
joy in the God of his salvation</i>.'
</p>

<p>
And the records show that Walter Petherick lived
to enjoy long life, abounding wealth, great honors,
and the clinging affection of his children's children.
And ever in his heart he cherished a deep, deep secret
and sang a rapturous song. For he reveled,
not only in the <i>gifts</i>, but in the <i>Giver</i>. He rejoiced
in <i>the Lord</i> and joyed in <i>the God of his salvation</i>.

<h3>DOCTOR BLUND'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
The doctor was the worst man in Bartown, and
that was saying a good deal. For Bartown had the
reputation of being 'the wickedest little hole in all
England.' It is Harold Begbie who, in <i>The Vigil</i>,
tells its story. Dr. Blund, he assures us, spent most
of his time drinking gin and playing billiards at
'The Angel.' In a professional point of view, only
one person in the little seaside town believed in him,
and that was the broken and bedraggled little woman
whose whole life had been darkened by his debauchery.
Mrs. Blund was never tired of singing
the doctor's praises. When she introduced him to
a newcomer, and told of his wondrous cures and
amazing skill, he listened like a man in a dream.
'Dr. Blund,'--so runs the story--'Dr. Blund was
twitching with excess of alcohol, and only muttered
and frowned as his wife talked of his powers. The
terrible old doctor, with his hairy, purple face and
his sunken eyes, seemed to think that his wife was
doing him the most dreadful dis-service. It was
wonderful that this little woman, instead of shrinking
from exhibiting her husband, should have so
pathetic a faith in the dreadful-looking rogue that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
she evidently fancied that he had but to be seen to
be chosen as medical adviser.'
</p>

<p>
Thus the story opens. It could scarcely be expected
that such a wreck could hold together for
long. Exactly half-way through the book I find
Mr. Rodwell, the young rector, standing at the
street-corner talking to Mr. Shorder, the wealthy
manufacturer. They are interrupted. Mrs. Blund
comes hurrying breathlessly round the corner.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Rodwell,' she pants, 'please come at once!
Dr. Blund! He's asking for you! I've been to the
vicarage, I've been everywhere, hunting for you.
Don't delay a moment, please!'
</p>

<p>
Richard Rodwell was an earnest young clergyman,
who had ideas of his own about things; and
the task to which he was now summoned was very
little to his taste. He saw in Blund a man who
had lived hideously and was now concerned to avert
his just punishment. He tried to believe that there
was some hope for such a wretch; but the attempt
was not altogether successful. He bent over the
dying man and talked of mercy and repentance and
forgiveness. But the words did not come from his
own soul, and they did not comfort the soul of the
man to whom they were addressed.
</p>

<p>
'There's something else!' he gasped.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing outside the mercy of God,' replied
the vicar.
</p>

<p>
'It's in the Bible, what I mean,' returned the dying
man.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>
'What is it?' asked Rodwell soothingly.
</p>

<p>
'It's a text, "Except a man be <i>born again</i>----"
You know the words, <i>Born again</i>. What does that
mean?'
</p>

<p>
The doctor, in his professional capacity, had often
seen a child draw its first breath, and had been impressed
by its utter pastlessness. It had nothing
to regret, nothing to forget. Everything was before
it; nothing behind. And here was a text that seemed
to promise such an experience a second time! To be
<i>born again</i>! What was it to be <i>born again</i>? The
dying doctor asked his insistent question repeatedly,
but the vicar was out of his depth. He floundered
pitifully. At last the doctor, to whom every moment
was precious beyond all price, lost patience with the
hesitating minister and changed the form of his
question. Looking fixedly into his visitor's eyes, he
exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, have <i>you</i> been <i>born again</i>?' Rodwell
hung his head in silence, and the voice from the bed
went on.
</p>

<p>
'Have you ever known in your life,' he asked,
'a moment when you felt that a great change happened
to you? Are you pretending? Have you
ever been conscious of <i>a new birth</i> in your soul?'
</p>

<p>
The vicar fenced with the question, but it was of
no avail. The dying man raised himself suddenly
on an elbow. 'You can't help me!' he cried angrily.
He seized Rodwell's wrist and held it tightly,
fiercely. As he spoke, the fingers tightened their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
grasp, and he bent Rodwell's hand down to the bed,
as it were for emphasis.
</p>

<p>
'You don't know,' he cried. 'You're pretending.
The words you say are words for the living. I am
a dying man. Have you the same message for the
living and the dying? Have I a lifetime before me
in which to work out repentance? You can't help
me! You don't know! You have never been <i>born
again</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Such a rebuke smites a minister like the sudden
coming of the Day of Judgment. After his conversion
John Wesley wrote a terrible letter to his
old counselor, William Law. 'How will you answer
to our common Lord,' he asks, 'that you, sir,
never led me into light? Why did I scarcely ever
hear you name the <i>name of Christ</i>? Why did you
never urge me to <i>faith in His blood</i>? I beseech
you, sir, to consider whether the true reason of your
never pressing this salvation upon me was not this--<i>that
you never had it yourself</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'It was a terrible discovery to make,' says Mr.
Begbie. 'To think that he--Richard Rodwell,
Vicar of Bartown--knew so little of the nature of
God that he could say no single word that had significance
for this dying soul! He was dumb. The
words on his lips were the words of the Church.
Out of his own heart, out of his own soul, out of
his own experience, he could say nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'Forgive me,' he said, as he bent over the form on
the bed, 'forgive me for failing you. It is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Christ who has failed; it is I.' He turned to go.
The dying man opened his eyes and looked at Rodwell
sadly and tragically.
</p>

<p>
'Try to learn what those words mean,' he muttered.
'<i>Born again!</i> It's the bad man's only chance.'
</p>

<p>
They parted, never to meet again; and from another
minister's lips the doctor learned the secret
for which he craved.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
It is very difficult to excuse Mr. Rodwell, especially
when we remember that the words that the
dying doctor found so captivating, and that he himself
found so perplexing, were originally intended
to meet just such cases as that of Dr. Blund.
</p>

<p>
'What is it to be <i>born again</i>? How can a man
be <i>born again</i>?' asked the voice from the bed.
</p>

<p>
'How can a man <i>be born</i> when he is old?' asked
Nicodemus, as he heard the Saviour's words uttered
for the first time.
</p>

<p>
'When he is old!' To Nicodemus, as to Dr.
Blund, there was something singularly attractive
about the thought of babyhood, the thought of pastlessness,
the thought of beginning life all over again.
But to the aged ruler, as to the aged doctor, it was
an insoluble enigma, an inscrutable mystery.
</p>

<p>
'<i>How?</i>' asked Nicodemus of the Saviour. '<i>How</i>
can a man <i>be born</i> when he is old?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>How?</i>' asked Dr. Blund of Mr. Rodwell. '<i>How</i>
can a man be <i>born again</i>?'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>
We all feel that, unless the gospel can meet just
such cases as these, we might almost as well have
no gospel at all. And yet we have also felt the
force of that persistent and penetrating <i>How?</i>
</p>

<p>
Dr. Blund is no frolic of Mr. Begbie's imagination.
Dr. Blund is the representative of all those--and
their name is legion--who, in the crisis of the
soul's secret history, have turned towards the
Saviour's strange saying with the most intense wistfulness
and yearning. Let me cite three instances--each
as unlike the others as it could possibly be--in
order to show that all sorts and conditions of
men have at some time felt as Dr. Blund felt in
those last hours of his. John Bunyan, the tinker
of Bedford, was born in the <i>seventeenth</i> century;
the Duke of Wellington, soldier and statesman, was
born in the <i>eighteenth</i> century; Frederick Charrington,
the London brewer, was born in the <i>nineteenth</i>
century. From a great cloud of available witnesses
I select these three.
</p>

<p>
As to John Bunyan, the story of the beginnings
of grace in the dreamer's soul is familiar to us all,
but it will do us no harm to hear it from his own
lips once again. 'Upon a day,' he says, 'the good
providence of God called me to Bedford, to work
at my calling; and in one of the streets of that town
I came to where there were three or four poor
women sitting in the sun talking about the things of
God; and being now willing to hear them discourse,
I drew near to hear what they said; but I heard,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
yet understood not; they were far above, out of
my reach; for their talk was about <i>a new birth</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Their talk was about a new birth!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Ye must be born again!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I heard</i>,' says Bunyan, '<i>but I understood not!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'At this,' he goes on to say, 'at this I felt my
heart begin to shake, for I saw that in all my
thoughts about salvation, <i>the new birth</i> did never
enter into my mind!'
</p>

<p>
Thus the soul of the sleeper awoke. He walked
the streets of Bedford asking the old, old question,
the question of Nicodemus, the question of Dr.
Blund, the question of us all. 'How can a man be
<i>born again</i>? How can a man be <i>born again</i>?'
</p>

<p>
From John Bunyan to the Duke of Wellington
seems a far cry. But the transition may not be as
drastic as it appears. Dr. W. H. Fitchett, who has
made a special study of the character and achievements
of the great Duke, recently told the story of
a remarkable and voluminous correspondence that
took place between Wellington and a young lady
named Miss Jenkins. To this earnest and devout
girl, her faith was the biggest thing in life. She
had but one passionate and quenchless desire: the
desire to share it with others. She sought for converts
everywhere. A murderer awaited execution
in the local gaol. Miss Jenkins obtained permission
to visit him. She entered the condemned cell,
pleaded with him, wept over him, won him to repentance,
and the man went to the scaffold blessing her.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>
Then, from the winning of the lowest, she turned
to the winning of the highest. She fastened her
eyes upon the Duke of Wellington, the victor of
Waterloo, the statesman of the hour, the most
commanding figure in the three kingdoms. Wellington
was then sixty-five, a man covered with honor
and absorbed in public affairs. But, to Miss Jenkins,
he was simply a great worldly figure, and, in
1834, she wrote a letter--a letter winged by many
prayers--warning him of the peril of living without
a sure, deep consciousness of the forgiveness of sins,
through the redemption of Jesus Christ. Wellington's
iron nature was strongly moved. He replied
by return of post, and thus inaugurated a correspondence
in the course of which he wrote to Miss
Jenkins no fewer than three hundred and ninety
letters. In the course of this amazing correspondence,
Miss Jenkins begged for an interview, and it
was granted. Miss Jenkins took out her New
Testament and read to the old warrior these very
words. '<i>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a
man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of
God!</i>' 'Here,' says Dr. Fitchett, in unfolding the
story, 'here was a preacher of quite a new type! A
girl's lips were reciting Christ's tremendous words:
"<i>Ye must be born again!</i>" She was addressing them
directly to him, and her uplifted finger was challenging
him. Some long-dormant religious sensibilities
awoke within him. The grace of the speaker,
and the mystic quality of the thing spoken, arrested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
him.' To the end of his days the Duke firmly believed
that, by means of this girl-prophet, God Himself
spoke to his soul that day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Frederick Charrington's story has been put
on record by Guy Thorne. He was the son of the
great brewer, the heir to more than a million pounds,
and his time was very largely his own. He traveled
and formed friendships. One of his earliest
friends was Lord Garvagh. They traveled together,
and, when they parted, Lord Garvagh asked Charrington
if he would grant him one request. 'When
you are quite alone,' his lordship pleaded, 'I should
like you to read slowly and carefully the third chapter
of John's Gospel!' Later on, Charrington met
William Rainsford, and the acquaintance ripened
into intimacy. 'Do you know what I wish you would
do, Fred?' Rainsford said to him one day. 'I wish,
when you are by yourself, that you would study the
third chapter of the Gospel of John!'
</p>

<p>
'This is a very curious thing,' Charrington said
to himself. 'My old friend, Lord Garvagh, and my
new friend, Rainsford, both say exactly the same
thing; and they both profess to be saved.'
</p>

<p>
Thus doubly challenged, he read the chapter with
the closest attention, and was arrested by the words:
'<i>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be
born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God!</i>'
'As I read,' he says, 'light came into my soul,' and
he ever afterwards regarded that moment as the
turning-point of his whole life.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Now, what did these men--these and a hundred
thousand more--see in the strange, mysterious
words that Jesus spoke to the aged ruler twenty
centuries ago? That is the question, and the question
is not a difficult one to answer.
</p>

<p>
<i>A new birth!</i> To be <i>born again</i>! What can it
mean? It can only mean one thing. 'I wish,' somebody
has sung----
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wish that there were some wonderful place<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Called the Land of Beginning Again,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Where all our mistakes and all our heartaches<br/></span>
<span class="i2">And all of our poor, selfish grief<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Could be dropped, like a shabby old coat, at the door,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">And never put on any more.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
The words, if they mean anything, mean that
there <i>is</i> such a place. A man <i>may</i> have a fresh
start. In describing the greatest change that took
place in his life--the greatest change that can take
place in any man's life--Frank Bullen says: 'I
love that description of conversion as the "<i>new
birth</i>." No other definition touches the truth of the
process at all. So helpless, so utterly knowledgeless,
possessing nothing but the vague consciousness
of life just begun!' Dr. Blund was thinking of the
babes whose first breath he had seen drawn. So
innocent; so pastless! Oh, to begin where they were
beginning! Oh, to be <i>born again</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Dr. Blund cannot begin where they were beginning.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
He cannot enjoy again--at any rate in this
world--the opportunities of growth and development
that were theirs. But he can be <i>born again</i>!
He can start afresh! Dr. Blund made that discovery
on his deathbed, and, in talking of the dead
doctor's experience, the young minister made the
same discovery a day or two later. He felt his
need; he turned in an agony of supplication to the
Saviour whom he had so often preached; and he,
too, entered into the new life.
</p>

<p>
'He made the great discovery,' Harold Begbie
says. 'It had happened; the longed-for event had
come; he stood by himself, all by himself, conscious
now of the heart; no longer satisfied either with his
own intellect or the traditions of a church. The
miracle had happened. He had discovered the helplessness
of humanity. He had discovered the need
of the soul. He had begun at last to see into the
heart of things.' He had been <i>born again</i>!
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of progress. There is the
progress that moves away from infancy towards
youth, towards maturity, towards age and decrepitude.
And there is a higher progress, a progress
that moves towards infancy. 'Except ye be converted
and become as little children,' Jesus said, 'ye
shall not enter into the kingdom of God.' And the
only way of becoming a little child once more is
by being <i>born again</i>. It is the glory of the gospel
that it offers a man that chance.

<h3>HEDLEY VICARS' TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
'<i>Those words are the sheet-anchor of my soul!</i>'
said Hedley Vicars, a gallant young Army officer,
as he sat talking to his sweetheart in the handsome
drawing-room at Terling Place.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Those words are more golden than gold!</i>' exclaimed
Miss Frances Ridley Havergal, and she
ordered that they should be inscribed upon her
tomb.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Those words did give a great ease to my spirit!</i>'
John Bunyan tells us.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Those words</i>,' said old Donald Menzies, the
mystic of Drumtochty, '<i>those words fell upon me
like a gleam from the Mercy-seat!</i>'
</p>

<p>
What words? Let us return to Hedley Vicars!
He was only twenty-eight when he fell, leading his
regiment--the Ninety-seventh--in action before
Sebastopol. The enemy attacked suddenly under
cover of the darkness. 'The men of the Ninety-seventh
behaved with the utmost gallantry and coolness,'
said Lord Raglan, in the historic dispatch
that reached England on Good Friday, 1855. 'They
were led by Captain Vicars, who, unfortunately,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
lost his life in the engagement; and I am assured
that nothing could be more distinguished than the
gallantry and good example which he set to the detachment
under his command.' His biographer tells
us that it was more than three years earlier--in
November, 1851--that, whilst awaiting in his room
the return of a brother officer, he idly turned over
the leaves of a Bible which lay on the table. The
words, '<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth
us from all sin</i>,' caught his eyes and profoundly impressed
his mind. 'If,' he said, as he closed the
sacred Volume, 'if this be true, I will henceforth
live by the grace of God as a man should live who
has been redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.'
That night he could scarcely sleep; the great words
repeated themselves again and again within his
throbbing brain; they seemed too good to be true.
</p>

<p>
'<i>All sin! All sin!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Cleanseth from all sin!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us
from all sin.</i>'
</p>

<p>
He never tired of telling of that wonderful experience.
Miss Marsh, to whom he was engaged
to be married, says that, almost as soon as they were
first introduced to each other, 'he gave her an outline
of the manner in which God had worked the
great change in his heart. With forceful simplicity
he told the point of the story; how the words,
"<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us
from all sin</i>," became the sheet-anchor of his soul,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
adding, "Thus was I born again of the Word of
God which liveth and abideth for ever!"'
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Away back in the infancy of the world I hear
one of the earliest of the Patriarchs uttering a great
and bitter cry. '<i>I have sinned!</i>' he cries; '<i>what shall
I do?</i>' And, as I turn over the leaves of my Bible,
I find that question echoed again and again, generation
after generation and age after age. Yet never
once does it receive the slightest hint or suggestion
of an answer. And, depend upon it, if the Son of
Man had never come into the world, it would have
echoed round the globe--still unanswered and unanswerable--until
this day. 'O Plato, Plato!' cried
Socrates, 'it may be that the gods can forgive sin,
but, alas, I do not see how!' Nor anybody else.
Job's question fell back upon his face; the universe
could give him no reply. It is very striking. And
so, here at the beginning of my Bible, I hear the
first man's question; and, here at the end of my
Bible, I hear the last man's answer!
</p>

<p>
'<i>What shall I do? What shall I do?</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I have sinned; what shall I do?</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us
from all sin!</i>'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
These two men--Job and John--present us, first
with a <i>comparison</i>, and then with a <i>contrast</i>. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
interesting to examine side by side their views of
the sin that represented so terrific a problem.
</p>

<p>
Job thought of it as a <i>contaminating</i> thing. He
felt that his soul was soiled. 'What shall I do?' he
cries, 'what shall I do? If I bathe myself in snow
water and wash my hands never so clean, yet shalt
Thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes
shall abhor me!' Every day of his life he thought
he heard, morning and noon and night, the awful
Voice of the Most High. 'Though thou wash thee
with niter, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity
is marked before Me, saith the Lord God.'
He felt as Macbeth felt when advised to cleanse
the stain from his guilty hands.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Clean from my hand! No, this my hand will rather<br/></span>
<span class="i0">The multitudinous seas incarnadine,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Making the green one red!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
Job was like the old lama, in Rudyard Kipling's
<i>Kim</i>, who, year after year, wandered through cities
and rice-fields, over the hills and across the plains,
always searching, but searching in vain, for the
River, the River of the Arrow, the River that
could cleanse from sin!
</p>

<p>
John, on the other hand, thought of sin as a
<i>condemning</i> thing. The great word 'condemnation'
occurs on almost every page of his writings. He
feels that every man's sin carries its own conviction.
It is like finger-print evidence; it speaks for itself;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
it needs no long procession of corroborating witnesses.
There it is! It tells its own terrible tale,
and there is no gainsaying it.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
And yet, looked at in another way, the thoughts
of these two men stand in sharp and striking contrast,
the one with the other. '<i>I have sinned</i>,' cried
Job; '<i>what shall I do? What shall I do?</i>'
</p>

<p>
But there is no reply. In the course of the stupendous
drama that bears his name, Job scours sea
and land, earth and sky, for some answer to the
wild questionings of his soul. He climbs the summits
of the loftiest mountains and thrids the labyrinth
of the deepest mine; he calls to the heights of
the heavens and to the depths of the sea. But there
is no answering voice, and he is left to nurse his
dumb and piteous despair. Every attempt that he
makes to rid his soul of its defilement is like the
effort of a man who, in trying to remove the stain
from his window, rubs on the wrong side of the
glass.
</p>

<p>
But, in contrast with all this, John saw the Cross!
How could he ever forget it? Had he not stood beside
it, gazed into the thorn-crowned face, and received
from those quivering lips their last sacred
bequest--the charge of the Saviour's mother? And,
all through the eventful years that followed, John
never tired of presenting the Cross as the only
answer to the Patriarch's question. He may not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
have perfectly understood it--no man ever yet comprehended
all its heights and sounded all its depths!
But it is easier to accept it than to reject it. For,
if I reject it, I am confronted by an enigma even
more unanswerable than Job's.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, why was He there as the Bearer of sin<br/></span>
<span class="i2">If on Jesus my guilt was not laid?<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing stream,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">If His dying my debt has not paid?<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
If, that is to say, the Cross is not the divine answer
to the mystery of all the ages, then who shall attempt
to solve the dark, inscrutable, impenetrable
mystery of the Cross?
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
But it is! Experience proves it! In the course
of his dazzling Apocalypse, John tells us that he
saw a war being waged in heaven; and the hosts of
righteousness overcame their powerful and sinister
foes by the virtue of the blood of the Lamb. I do
not know what he means--never expect to know
in this world. But I know that, in this life, something
very like it happens every day.
</p>

<p>
Martin Luther says that, in one of his periods of
depression at the Wartburg, it seemed to him that
he saw a hideous and malignant form inscribing
the record of his own transgressions round the walls
of his room. There seemed to be no end to the list--sins
of thought, sins of word, sins of deed, sins
of omission, sins of commission, secret sins, open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
sins--the pitiless scribe wrote on and on interminably.
Whilst the accuser was thus occupied,
Luther bowed his head and prayed. When he
looked up again, the writer had paused, and, turning,
faced him.
</p>

<p>
'Thou hast forgotten just one thing!' said Luther.
</p>

<p>
'And that--?' asked his tormentor.
</p>

<p>
'Take thy pen once more and write across it all:
"<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us
from all sin!</i>"' And, at the utterance of those
words, the spirit vanished and the walls were clean!
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Grace Abounding</i>, Bunyan tells us of a
period in his life during which his soul seemed to be
held in fetters of brass; and, every step he took, he
took to the sound of the clanking of chains. 'But
about ten or eleven o'clock on a certain day,' he
says, 'as I was walking under a hedge (full of sorrow
and guilt, God knows), suddenly this sentence
rushed in upon me, "<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His
Son, cleanseth us from all sin.</i>" At this I made a
stand in my spirit and began to conceive peace in my
soul, and methought I saw as if the tempter did leer
and steal away from me, as being ashamed of what
he had done. At the same time also I had my sin
and the blood of Christ thus represented to me:
that my sin, when compared to the blood of Christ,
was no more to it than this little clod or stone is to
the vast and wide field that here I see. This gave
me good encouragement.'
</p>

<p>
Neither Martin Luther nor John Bunyan would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
object to my setting them in the company of Donald
Menzies. For, like them, Donald was at war with
principalities and powers, with the rulers of the
darkness of this world, with spiritual wickedness in
high places. In the lonely anguish of that grim
struggle it seemed as though, at the last, the gates
of hell must have prevailed against him.
</p>

<p>
'Then,' he says, 'I heard a voice, oh, yes, as plain
as you are hearing me: "<i>The blood of Jesus Christ,
His Son, cleanseth us from all sin.</i>" It was like a
gleam from the Mercy-seat, but I waited to see
whether Satan had any answer and my heart was
standing still. But there was no word from him,
not one word. Then I leaped to my feet and cried,
"Get thee behind me, Satan!" And I looked round,
and there was no one to be seen but Janet in her
chair with the tears on her cheeks, and she was
saying, "Thanks be to God which giveth us the victory
through our Lord Jesus Christ!"'
</p>

<p>
'<i>When I uttered those words,</i>' says Luther, '<i>the
evil spirit vanished and the walls were clean!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>When I made a stand upon those words,</i>' says
Bunyan, '<i>the tempter did steal away from me and I
entered into peace!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>When I heard those words,</i>' says Donald Menzies,
'<i>I waited to see if Satan had any answer, but
there was no word from him, not one word!</i>'
</p>

<p>
This, surely, is what the seer means when he
says that he saw all the hosts of evil routed and
scattered by the virtue of the blood of the Lamb.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Down at the library yesterday afternoon I spent
an hour in glancing through the various volumes
of Southey's <i>Commonplace Book</i>. And, among
a vast assortment of musty notes that are now of
interest to nobody, I came upon this: 'I have been
reading of a man on the Malabar coast who had
inquired of many devotees and priests as to how
he might make atonement for his sins. At last he
was directed to drive iron spikes, sufficiently
blunted, through his sandals, and on these spikes
he was to place his naked feet and then walk a
distance of five hundred miles. He undertook the
journey, but loss of blood and exhaustion of body
compelled him to rest one day under the shade of a
spreading tree. As he lay there, a missionary approached
and began to preach the gospel. He announced
as his theme the words: "<i>The blood of
Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth us from all sin</i>."
Whilst the evangelist still preached, the man sprang
up, tore off his sandals, and cried aloud: "That is
what I want! That is what I want!" And he became
a living witness to the fact that the redeeming
blood of Christ <i>does</i> cleanse from human guilt.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>That is what I want!</i>' cried Southey's pilgrim on
the coast of Malabar.
</p>

<p>
'<i>That is what I want!</i>' cried Luther in the Wartburg.
</p>

<p>
'<i>That is what I want!</i>' cried Bunyan at Bedford.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>
'<i>That is what I want!</i>' cried Donald Menzies at
Drumtochty.

<p>
'<i>That is what I want!</i>' exclaimed young Hedley
Vicars, as his startled eyes fell upon the tremendous
words that seemed to leap from the Bible on the
table. '<i>The blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanseth
us from all sin.</i>' 'That is what I want! That is
what I want!'
</p>

<p>
Hedley Vicars appropriated the priceless gift held
out to him, and his whole life was transfigured in
consequence. His life--and his death! For, on
that fatal night before Sebastopol, it was with Hedley
Vicars as it was with the soldier with whom the
poet has familiarized us. Everybody knows the
story. Two men of God moved in the darkness
across the field on which, that day, a battle had
been fought.

<h3>SILAS WRIGHT'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Silas Wright was deprived by sheer modesty of
the honor of being President of the United States.
His is one of the truly Homeric figures in American
history. By downright purity of motive,
transparency of purpose, and the devotion of commanding
powers to the public good, he won for himself
the honor, the love and the unbounded confidence
of all his fellows. It used to be said of him
that he was as honest as any man under heaven
<i>or in it</i>. He might have aspired to any office to
which it was in America's power to call him. Only
his extreme humility, and his dread of impeding
the promotion of his friends, kept him from rising
to a position in which his name would have taken
its place with those of Washington and Lincoln.
But he refused almost every honor. 'He refused
cabinet appointments,' says Benton, in his <i>Thirty
Years' View</i>. 'He refused a seat on the bench of
the Supreme Court of the United States; he rejected
instantly the nomination of 1844 for Vice-President;
he refused to be nominated for the Presidency.
He spent as much time in declining office
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
as others did in winning it. The offices he did
accept were thrust upon him. He was born great
and above office and unwillingly descended to it.'
Whittier is very conservative in his choice of heroes.
Those whom he commemorates in verse are
not only great men, but good ones. And Silas
Wright is among them. 'Man of the millions,' he
says, in the lines that he penned on hearing of Mr.
Wright's death:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Man of the millions, thou art lost too soon!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Portents at which the bravest stand aghast--<br/></span>
<span class="i0">The birththroes of a Future, strange and vast,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Alarm the land; yet thou, so wise, and strong,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Suddenly summoned to the burial bed,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Lapped in its slumbers deep and ever long,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Hear'st not the tumult surging overhead.<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Who now shall rally Freedom's scattered host?<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Who wear the mantle of the leader lost?<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
The splendid personality of Silas Wright has
been best revealed to us in Irving Bacheller's <i>The
Light in the Clearing</i>. The book is partly history
and partly commentary and partly fiction. Silas
Wright, says Irving Bacheller, carried the candle
of the Lord; and all the world rejoiced in its radiance.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Barton Baynes, the hero of the book--for whose
actuality and historicity the author vouches--is an
orphan brought up on a farm by his Uncle Peabody
and Aunt Deel. Getting into all sorts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
scrapes, he makes up his mind that he is too heavy
a burden on the affectionate and good-natured
couple; and one night he runs away. Out in the
darkness, however, he meets with strange adventures,
loses his way, and at length finds himself in
the hands of Silas Wright, the Comptroller. The
Senator first falls in love with the bright-faced,
open-hearted, intelligent boy, and then takes him
back to his uncle's farm. From that moment the
friendship between the two--the great man and the
obscure country boy--grows apace. After a while
the Senator visits the district to deliver an address,
and he spends the night at the farmhouse. It is a
great occasion for Bart; and after supper an incident
occurs that colors all his life and strikes the
keynote of the book. As Barton approaches Mr.
Wright to say Good-night, the Senator says:
</p>

<p>
'I shall be gone when you are up in the morning.
It may be a long time before I see you; I shall leave
something for you in a sealed envelope with your
name on it. You are not to open the envelope until
you go away to school. I know how you will feel
that first day. When night falls, you will think of
your aunt and uncle and be very lonely. When you
go to your room for the night I want you to sit down
all by yourself and read what I shall write. They
will be, I think, the most impressive words ever
written. You will think them over, but you will not
understand them for a long time. Ask every wise
man you meet to explain them to you, for all your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
happiness will depend upon your understanding of
those few words in the envelope.'
</p>

<p>
The words in the sealed envelope!
</p>

<p>
What are the mysterious words in the envelope?
</p>

<p>
And what if the sealed envelope contains a <i>text</i>?
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
In the morning, when Barton rose, the Senator
was gone, and Aunt Deel handed the boy the sealed
envelope. It was addressed: 'Master Barton
Baynes; to be opened when he leaves home to go to
school.' That day soon came. At the Canton
Academy, under the care of the excellent Michael
Hacket, Bart felt terribly lonely, and, in accordance
with the Senator's instructions, he opened the note.
And this is what he read:
</p>

<p>
'Dear Bart, I want you to ask the wisest man
you know to explain these words to you. I suggest
that you commit them to memory and think often
of their meaning. They are from Job: "<i>His bones
are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down
with him in the dust.</i>" I believe that they are the
most impressive in all the literature I have read.--Silas
Wright.'
</p>

<p>
Bart soon learned to love and admire the schoolmaster;
<i>he</i> was the wisest man he knew; to <i>him</i>,
therefore, he went for an explanation of the words.
</p>

<p>
'All true!' exclaimed Mr. Hacket, after reading
the note. 'I have seen it sinking into the bones of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the young, and I have seen it lying down with the
aged in the dust of their graves. Your body is like
a sponge; it takes things in and holds them and
feeds upon them. A part of every apple that you
eat sinks down into your blood and bones. You
can't get it out. It's the same with the books that
you read and the thoughts that you enjoy. They
go down into your bones and you can't get them
out. <i>A man's bones are full of the sin of his youth,
which lies down with him in the dust!</i>'
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
But the best exposition of the text is not Michael
Hacket's, but Irving Bacheller's. The whole book
is a vivid and arresting and terrible forth-setting
of the impressive words that Barton found in his
sealed envelope.
</p>

<p>
All through the book two dreadful characters
move side by side--Benjamin Grimshaw and Silent
Kate. Benjamin Grimshaw is rich and proud and
pitiless. Everybody is afraid of him. But Roving
Kate is not afraid. Indeed, he seems to be more
afraid of her. Wherever he is, she is there. She
is wild and bony and ragged. She is, or pretends to
be, half demented. She tells fortunes with strange
antics and gesticulations, scrawling her prognostications
upon stray slips of paper. But Benjamin
Grimshaw is the main object of her attention. She
hates him, and hates him all the more terribly because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
she once loved him. For Roving Kate, the
Silent Woman, was once Kate Fullerton, Squire
Fullerton's pretty daughter. And Benjamin Grimshaw
had loved her, and betrayed her, and spurned
her, and married another. In the village cemetery
you might have seen a tombstone bearing her name.
Her father erected it to show that she was dead <i>to
him</i> for ever. Poor Kate had never known her
mother. And so, in the course of the story, Benjamin
Grimshaw had two sons, only one of whom he
recognized. For Kate Fullerton was the mother
of the other. And, in her shame and her anger
and her hate, Kate resolved to follow the father of
her base-born child all the days of his life; and there
she stands--unkempt, repulsive, menacing--always
near him, the living embodiment of <i>the sin of his
youth</i>.
</p>

<p>
Amos Grimshaw, his petted and pampered son,
comes to the gallows. He is convicted of murder
upon the highway. The father is in court when the
Judge pronounces the awful sentence. And, of
course, Roving Kate is there. Ragged as ever, the
Silent Woman is waiting for him as he comes down
the steps. She shoots out a bony finger at him, as,
bowed and broken, he passes into the street. He
turns and strikes at her with his cane.
</p>

<p>
'Go away from me,' he cries. 'Take her away,
somebody! I can't stand it! She's killing me!
Take her away!'
</p>

<p>
His face turns purple and then livid. He reels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and falls headlong. He is dead! Three days later
they bury him. Roving Kate stands by the graveside,
strangely changed. She is decently dressed;
her hair is neatly combed; the wild look has left
her eyes. She looks like one whose back is relieved
of a heavy burden. She scatters little red
squares of paper into the grave, her lips moving
silently. These are her last curses. Barton Baynes
and his schoolmaster, Mr. Hacket, are standing by.
</p>

<p>
'<i>The scarlet sins of his youth are lying down with
him in the dust</i>,' whispers the master to his pupil as
they walk away together.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
This is terrible enough--the thought of our sins
surrounding our deathbeds and lying down with us
in our graves--but the book contains something
more profound and terrible still!
</p>

<p>
For, in addition to the grave of Benjamin Grimshaw,
from which we have just turned sadly away,
there are two other graves in the book. The one
is a felon's grave--the grave of Amos Grimshaw.
And what sins are these that are lying down with
him in the dust? They are some of them his own;
and they are some of them his father's; and they
are some of them the sins of Roving Kate, the Silent
Woman. Yes, they are some of them the
woman's sins. For when Amos was but an impressionable
boy, Kate had supplied him with literature
by which she hoped to pollute and ruin him.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>
Out of the deathless hatred that she bore to the
father, she longed to destroy the son, body and
soul. She gave him tales that would inflame his
fancy and excite his baser instincts, tales that glorified
robbery, murder and villainy of every kind.
If Amos Grimshaw had been a good man's son,
and if ennobling influences had been brought to
bear upon him, he might have lived to old age
and gone down at last to an honored grave. But
his father's example was always before him, and
Kate's books did their dreadful work only too well.
He became a highway robber; he shot a stranger
on a lonely road. It came out in evidence that the
deed had been perpetrated under circumstances
identical with those described in one of the sensational
stories found in the Grimshaw barn--the
stories Kate had given him!
</p>

<p>
'It's the same with the books you read,' the
schoolmaster had said, when Bart sought from him
an explanation of the text in the sealed envelope;
'they go down into your bones and you can't get
them out.'
</p>

<p>
And Kate's books had gone down into Amos
Grimshaw's bones; and thus her sins and his
father's sins lay down in the dust of the felon's
grave and mingled with his own. No exposition of
Silas Wright's text could be more arresting or
alarming than that. My sins may overflow from
my grave and lie down in the dust with my children!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
And, on the very last page of <i>The Light in the
Clearing</i>, we have an even more striking presentment
of the same profound truth. For I said that,
in the book, there is yet one other grave. It is a
lonely grave up among the hills--the grave of the
stranger who was shot by Amos Grimshaw that
dark night; and this time it is old Kate who sits
weeping beside it. For who was the stranger murdered
upon the highway? It turns out to have
been <i>Kate's own son</i>!
</p>

<p>
'It is very sorrowful,' she moans. 'He was trying
to find me when he died!'
</p>

<p>
And so the murderer and the murdered were
step-brothers! They were both the sons of Benjamin Grimshaw!
</p>

<p>
And, in this grave up among the hills, there lie
down with poor murdered Enoch his own sins--whatever
they may have been--and his father's
sins--the sins that made him an outcast and a fugitive--and
his mother's sins, the sins of the only
being who loved him!
</p>

<p>
Yes, his mother's sins; for his mother's sins had
slain him. In her hatred of Benjamin Grimshaw,
she had moved Amos Grimshaw to become a murderer,
and he had murdered--<i>her own son!</i>
</p>

<p>
'It is very sorrowful!' she moans.
</p>

<p>
It is indeed; sin is always sorrowful.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
'<i>Wherefore come now and let us reason together,
saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet, they
shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
crimson, they shall be as wool.</i>'
</p>

<p>
It is best to make an end of them, and to turn
from them, once and for all, that they lie down at
last neither with us nor with our children.

<h3>MICHAEL FARADAY'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
The lecturer had vanished! A crowded gathering
of distinguished scientists had been listening, spellbound,
to the masterly expositions of Michael Faraday.
For an hour he had held his brilliant audience
enthralled as he had demonstrated the nature and
properties of the magnet. And he had brought his
lecture to a close with an experiment so novel, so
bewildering and so triumphant that, for some time
after he resumed his seat, the house rocked with
enthusiastic applause. And then the Prince of
Wales--afterwards King Edward the Seventh--rose
to propose a motion of congratulation. The
resolution, having been duly seconded, was carried
with renewed thunders of applause. But the uproar
was succeeded by a strange silence. The assembly
waited for Faraday's reply; but the lecturer had
vanished! What had become of him? Only two
or three of his more intimate friends were in the
secret. They knew that the great chemist was
something more than a great chemist; he was a great
Christian. He was an elder of a little Sandemanian
Church--a church that never boasted more than
twenty members. The hour at which Faraday concluded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
his lecture was the hour of the week-night
prayer-meeting. That meeting he never neglected.
And, under cover of the cheering and applause, the
lecturer had slipped out of the crowded hall and
hurried off to the little meeting-house where two
or three had met together to renew their fellowship
with God.
</p>

<p>
In that one incident the man stands revealed.
All the sublimities and all the simplicities of life
met in his soul. The master of all the sciences, he
kept in his breast the heart of a little child. Mr.
Cosmo Monkhouse has well asked--
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Was ever man so simple and so sage,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">So crowned and yet so careless of a prize?<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Great Faraday, who made the world so wise,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And loved the labor better than the wage!<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this, you say, is how he looked in age,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">With that strong brow and these great humble eyes<br/></span>
<span class="i2">That seem to look with reverent surprise<br/></span>
<span class="i0">On all outside himself. Turn o'er the page,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Recording Angel, it is white as snow!<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, God, a fitting messenger was he<br/></span>
<span class="i0">To show Thy mysteries to us below!<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Child as he came has he returned to Thee!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Would he could come but once again to show<br/></span>
<span class="i2">The wonder-deep of his simplicity!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
In him the simplicities were always stronger than
the sublimities; the child outlived the sage. As he
lay dying they tried to interview the professor, but
it was the little child in him that answered them.
</p>

<p>
'What are your speculations?' they inquired.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>
'Speculations?' he asked, in wondering surprise.
'Speculations! I have none! I am resting on certainties.
<i>I know whom I have believed and am persuaded
that He is able to keep that which I have
committed unto Him against that day!</i>' And, reveling
like a little child in those cloudless simplicities,
his great soul passed away.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Faraday was a perpetual mystery. He baffled
all his colleagues and companions. Nobody could
understand how the most learned man of his time
could find in his faith those restful certainties on
which he so calmly and securely reposed. They saw
him pass from a meeting of the Royal Society to
sit at the feet of a certain local preacher who was
notorious for his illiteracy; and the spectacle filled
them with bewilderment and wonder. Some suggested
that he was, in an intellectual sense, living a
double life. Tyndall said that, when Faraday
opened the door of his oratory, he shut that of his
laboratory. He did nothing of the kind. He never
closed his eyes to any fragment of truth; he never
divided his mind into watertight compartments; he
never shrank from the approach of a doubt. He
saw life whole. His biography has been written
a dozen times; and each writer views it from a new
angle. But in one respect they all agree. They
agree that Michael Faraday was the most transparently
honest soul that the realm of science has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
ever known. He moved for fifty years amidst the
speculations of science whilst, in his soul, the certainties
that cannot be shaken were singing their
deathless song. Like a coastguard who, standing
on some tall cliff, surveys the heaving waters, Faraday
stood, with his feet upon the rock, looking out
upon a restless sea of surmise and conjecture. In
life, as in death, he rested his soul upon certainties.
And if you will ask what those certainties were,
his biographers will tell you that they were three.
</p>

<p>
1. <i>He trusted implicitly in the Father's love.</i> 'My
faculties are slipping away day by day,' he wrote
to his niece from his deathbed. 'Happy is it for
all of us that our true good lies not in them. As
they ebb, may they leave us as little children trusting
in the Father of Mercies and accepting His unspeakable
gift.'
</p>

<p>
2. <i>He trusted implicitly in the Redeeming Work
of His Saviour.</i> 'The plan of salvation is so simple,'
he wrote, 'that anyone can understand it--love to
Christ springing from the love that He bears us,
the love that led Him to undertake our salvation.'
</p>

<p>
3. <i>He trusted implicitly in the Written Word.</i>
'To complete this picture,' says Dr. Bence Jones,
in bringing to a close his great two-volume biography,
'to complete this picture, I must add that
Faraday's standard of duty was not founded upon
any intuitive ideas of right and wrong, nor was it
fashioned upon any outward experiences of time
and place; but it was formed entirely on what he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
held to be the revelation of the will of God in the
written Word, and throughout all his life his faith
led him to act up to the very letter of it.'
</p>

<p>
'On these certainties,' he exclaimed, 'I stake
everything! On these certainties I rest my soul!'
And, summing up the three in one, he added, '<i>For
I am persuaded that He is able to keep that which I
have committed unto Him against that day</i>.'
</p>

<p>
It is wonderful how the universal heart aches
for assurance, for confidence, for finality, for certainty.
Mr. Dan Crawford tells of a cannibal chief
beside whose deathbed an African boy was reading
selections from the Gospel of John. He was impressed
by the frequent recurrence of the words
'<i>verily, verily</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'What do they mean?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'They mean "<i>certainly, certainly!</i>"'
</p>

<p>
'Then,' exclaimed the dying man, with a sigh of
infinite relief, 'they shall be my pillow. I rest on
them.'
</p>

<p>
Sage or savage, it is all the same. Bunyan's
great night was the night on which he found that
same pillow. 'It was with joy that I told my wife,
"O, now I know, <i>I know</i>!" That night was a good
night to me! I never had a better. I longed for
the company of some of God's people, that I might
have imparted unto them what God had showed me.
Christ was a precious Christ to my soul that night;
I could scarcely lie in my bed for joy and peace
and triumph through Christ!'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>
'<i>Those words shall be my pillow!</i>' said the African
chief.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Those words shall be my pillow!</i>' said the English
scientist.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Those words shall be my pillow!</i>' cried John
Bunyan.
</p>

<p>
'<i>For I am persuaded that He is able to keep that
which I have committed unto Him against that day!</i>'
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
'<i>He is able to keep!</i>' That was the sublime confidence
that won the heart of John Newton. It came
to him in the form of a dream on his voyage home
from Venice. I have told the story in full in <i>A

great impression upon me!' The same thought
made an indelible impression upon the mind of
Faraday, and he clung tenaciously to it at the last.

<p>
Faraday's text is an ill-used text. It is frequently
mis-quoted. It occurred one day in the course of
a theological lesson over which Rabbi Duncan was
presiding.
</p>

<p>
'Repeat that passage!' said the Rabbi to the student
who had just spoken.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I know in whom I have</i>----'
</p>

<p>
'My dear sir,' interrupted the Rabbi, 'you must
never let even a preposition come between you and
your Saviour!'
</p>

<p>
And when Dr. Alexander, of Princeton, was
dying, a friend endeavored to fortify his faith by
reciting some of the most familiar passages and
promises. Presently he ventured upon the words:
</p>

<p>
'<i>I know in whom I have believed, and</i>----'
</p>

<p>
But the sick man raised his hand.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>
'No, no,' exclaimed the dying Principal, 'it is not
"I know <i>in</i> whom" but "I know <i>whom</i>"; I cannot
have even the little word "<i>in</i>" between me and
Christ. <i>I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded
that He is able to keep that which I have
committed unto Him against that day!</i>'
</p>

<p>
John Oxenham has expressed the same thought
with an accent and emphasis well worthy of the
theme:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not What, but <i>Whom</i>, I do believe,<br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That</i>, in my darkest hour of need,<br/></span>

<span class="i0">To mortal man may give.<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not What but <i>Whom</i>.<br/></span>
<span class="i0">For Christ is more than all the creeds,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And His full life of gentle deeds<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Shall all the creeds outlive.<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not What I do believe, but <i>Whom</i>.<br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who</i> walks beside me in the gloom?<br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who</i> shares the burden wearisome?<br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who</i> all the dim way doth illume,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">And bids me look beyond the tomb<br/></span>
<span class="i4">The larger life to live?<br/></span>

<span class="i0">But <i>Whom</i>!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Not What,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>Whom</i>!<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
It was a Person, a Living and Divine Person, of
whom Faraday was so certain and on whom he
rested so securely at the last.

<p>
Is there in all Scottish literature a more robust,
more satisfying, or more lovable character than
<i>Donal Grant</i>? Readers of George Macdonald will
cherish the thought of Donal as long as they live.
He was the child of the open air; his character
was formed during long and lonely tramps on the
wide moor and among the rugged mountains; it
was strengthened and sweetened by communion
with sheep and dogs and cattle, with stars and winds
and stormy skies. He was disciplined by sharp suffering
and bitter disappointments. And he became
to all who knew him a tower of strength, a sure
refuge, a strong city, and the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land. As a shepherd-boy among
the hills he learned to read his Greek Testament;
and, later on, he became tutor at the Castle Graham.
It was his business in life to instruct little Davie,
the younger son of Lord Morven; and he had his
own way of doing it.
</p>

<p>
'Davie,' he said one day, 'there is One who understands
every boy, and understands each separate
boy as well as if there were no other boy in the
whole world.'
</p>

<p>
'Tell me who it is!' demanded Davie.
</p>

<p>
'That is what I have to <i>teach</i> you; mere <i>telling</i>
is not much use. <i>Telling</i> is what makes people
think they know when they do not, and makes them
foolish.'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>
'Well, what is his name?'
</p>

<p>
'I will not tell you that just yet; for then you
would think that you knew Him when you knew
next to nothing about Him. Look here! Look at
this book!' He pulled from his pocket a copy of
Boethius. 'Look at the name on the back of it;
it is the name of the man who wrote that book.'
</p>

<p>
Davie spelled it out.
</p>

<p>
'Now you know all about the book, don't you?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir, I don't know anything about it.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then, my father's name is Robert Grant;
you know now what a good man he is!'
</p>

<p>
'No, I don't!' replied Davie.
</p>

<p>
And so Donal led Davie to see that to know <i>the
name</i> of Jesus, and to know <i>about</i> Jesus is not to
know <i>Jesus</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I know <i>Him</i>!' cried Faraday in triumph.
</p>

<p>
George Macdonald makes Faraday's text the
master-passion of his hero's life to the last. All
through the adventures recorded in the book, Donal
Grant behaves like a man who is very sure of God.
'<i>I know Him</i>,' he seems to say. '<i>I know Him.</i>'
And the closing sentences of the story tell us that
'Donal is still a present power of heat and light in
the town of Auchars. He wears the same solemn
look, the same hovering smile. That look and that
smile say to those who can read them, "<i>I know
whom I have believed</i>." His life is hid with Christ
in God; he has no anxiety about anything; God is,
and all is well.'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
'<i>I know whom I have believed.</i>'
</p>

<p>
Pascal had the words engraved upon his seal;
Canon Ainger left instructions that they should be
inscribed on his tomb at Darley Abbey; but, like
Donal Grant, Michael Faraday wove them into the
very warp and woof, the fiber and fabric of his
daily life.
</p>

<p>
'Speculations!' he cried in dismay, 'speculations!
I have none! I am resting on certainties! <i>For I
know whom I have believed and am persuaded that
He is able to keep that which I have committed unto
Him against that day!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Happy the heads that, in the soul's last straits,
find themselves pillowed serenely there!

<h3>JANET DEMPSTER'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Sitting here in my pleasaunce on the lawn, surrounded
by a riot of hollyhocks, foxgloves, roses,
geraniums, and other English flowers that she described
so vividly, and loved so well, I find myself
celebrating in my own way the hundredth anniversary
of the birth of George Eliot. Lying open beside
me on the garden-seat is a very well-worn copy
of <i>Janet's Repentance</i>. It has been read many times,
and must be read again to-day. For even those who
cannot go as far as Dr. Marcus Dods in pronouncing
it 'one of the greatest religious books ever written'
will at least agree that in religious feeling,
spiritual insight and evangelical intensity, it is
among the most noble and most notable of our
English classics. The pity of it is that, long before
the book was written, its brilliant authoress had
drifted away from that simple and majestic faith
which she so tenderly portrays. Indeed, I have
sometimes fancied that she wrote of Janet with a
great wistfulness in her heart. She seems to have
felt that if, in the straits of her soul, she had found
her storm-tossed spirit in communion with personalities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
like those by whom Janet was surrounded in
the day of her distress, her spiritual pilgrimage
might have been a sunnier one. But she drifted.
No other word will describe the process. Some
powerful but sensitive minds, like that of Goethe--with
whose works she was so familiar--have been
driven or torn from their anchorage by some sudden
and desolating calamity; but with George Eliot it
was quite otherwise. She was a gentle English girl,
born on a farm, and passionately attached to the
quiet beauty of the countryside. She delighted in
the village green, the rectory garden, the fields waving
with golden buttercups, and the shady woods in
which the primroses twinkled. She loved to watch
the poppies tossing in the corn, the wind sweeping
over the red sea of clover, and the hyacinths nodding
on the banks of the silvery stream. The smell
of the hay and the song of the birds and the life
of the fields were her ceaseless satisfaction and refreshment.
Perhaps, as she wandered about those
winding lanes and lonely bridle-paths, she became
too contemplative, too introspective, too much addicted
to the analysis of frames and feelings. Perhaps,
dwelling so exclusively on the abstract and the
ideal, her fresh young spirit became unfitted for its
rude impact with the actual and the real. Perhaps,
too, she was unfortunate in respect of the particular
specimens of the evangelical faith that came
under her notice. Perhaps! At any rate, she came
at length into daily contact with men and women,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and her girlish faith reeled under the shock. It is
one of the most grievous tragedies of the spiritual
realm that conscience often finds the sunny climate
of an ardent evangelism singularly enervating. The
<i>emotional</i> side of one's nature luxuriates in an atmosphere
in which the <i>ethical</i> side becomes languid
and relaxed. A man must be very careful, as Mr.
Gladstone once incisively observed, to prevent his
religion from damaging his morality. The simpleminded
people with whom this sharp-witted and
fresh-spirited young Englishwoman met had not
fortified themselves against that insidious peril.
One woman told a lie and the offense was sheeted
home to her. '<i>Ah, well</i>,' she replied, in a nonchalant
and easy way, '<i>I do not feel that I have
grieved the Spirit much!</i>' George Eliot was horrified.
She saw, to her disgust, that strong religious
feeling could consist with flagrant dishonor. Her
finely poised and sensitive soul experienced a revolt
and a rebound. She changed none of her opinions,
yet she changed the entire attitude of her mind;
and, with the passage of time, the new attitude produced
new ideas. She had not quarreled with the
faith of her childhood; she simply lost her love for
it. Her anchor relinquished its hold, and, almost imperceptibly,
she drifted. 'She glided out of the faith,'
as Principal Fairbairn so expressively puts it, 'as
easily and as softly as if she had been a ship obeying
wind and tide, and her faith a sea that opened silently
before and closed noiselessly behind her.'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>
Wherefore let all those who name the name of
Christ depart from iniquity! For if, through any
glaring inconsistency between my faith and my behavior,
I offend one of these little ones that believe
in Him, it were better, so the Master Himself declared,
that a millstone were hanged about my neck
and that I were cast into the depths of the sea.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Now, in the story that lies open on the garden-seat
beside me, all the characters are very religious
people. Yet they are divided sharply into two
classes. There are the very religious people who
are all the worse for their religion, and there are
the very religious people who are all the better for
it. Mr. Dempster is a very religious man. In the
opening sentence of the story, the first sentence in
the book, he acknowledges his indebtedness to his
Creator. He is a very religious man--and a
drunkard! Mr. Budd is also a very religious man.
Indeed, he is warden at the Parish Church. 'He is
a small, sleek-headed bachelor of five and forty,
whose scandalous life has long furnished his more
moral neighbors with an afterdinner joke.' But
a very religious man is Mr. Budd! Mrs. Linnett
is a very religious woman. She dotes on religious
biography. 'On taking up the biography of a celebrated
preacher, she immediately turns to the end
to see what he died of,' and she likes the book all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the better if a sinister element enters into its composition.
Mrs. Linnett is a very religious woman--and
a gossip! We are introduced to a whole
group of such characters--men and women who are
very religious, but who are none the better for their
religion.
</p>

<p>
And, side by side with these unamiable figures,
are a set of people, equally religious, whose characters
are immeasurably sweetened and strengthened
by their religion. It is not that they profess another
faith, attend another church, or spend lives
remote from the affairs with which the others have
to do. As George Eliot herself pointed out, when
the publisher hesitated to commit himself to this
manuscript, it was not a case of one religion against
another, or of one creed against another, or of one
church against another, or even of one minister
against another. The members of this second
group move in the same environment as do the
members of the first; Sunday by Sunday they make
their way to the self-same sanctuaries; yet every
day they grow in gentleness, in thoughtfulness, in
kindness, and in all those graces of behavior that
constitute the charm of lovable and helpful lives.
In this attractive group we find Mr. Jerome, Mr.
Tryan, and little Mrs. Pettifer.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, an old story, vividly and startlingly
retold. The same cause will produce diametrically
opposite effects. The sun that softens
the wax hardens the clay. The benefit that I derive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
from my religion, and the enjoyment that it affords
me, must depend upon the response that I
make to it. The rays of light that fade my coat
add a warmer blush to the petals of the rose. Why?
My coat does not want the light and makes no response
to it; the rose cannot bloom without the light
and drinks in the soft rays as the source of all its
beauty. Under the influence of the sunshine, the
violets in the vase droop and become noisome; the
living lilies under my window unfold and assume
an even statelier grace. It is all a matter of response.
Religion was always beating upon the lives
of Mr. Dempster and Mr. Budd and Mrs. Linnett,
as the sunlight beats upon the coat and the cut-flowers.
They did not open their hearts to it; they
made no eager response to it; it was a thing that
shone upon the surface, and that was all. Their
lives consequently wilted and shriveled and grew
less beautiful. They were like violets made vile by
the very light that was designed to make them lovely.
Mr. Tryan, Mr. Jerome and Mrs. Pettifer, on the
other hand, opened their hearts to the love of God
as the rose opens its petals to the light of the sun.
Their religion was a revelry to them. So far from
its merely beating upon the surface, as the sunlight
beats upon the surface of the coat, it saturated the
very depths of their being. They were like the lilies
under my window; the rays that withered the violets
in the vase only make <i>them</i> more graceful and more
fair.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Here, then, are the two groups; and the central
scene of the story is the transfer of the principal
character from the one group to the other. Janet
Dempster, the wife of Robert Dempster, is, like
her husband, very religious, but, like him, she is
none the better for her religion. But matters at
home hurry to a climax. Dempster drinks more
and more, and, drinking, goes from bad to worse.
He treats his wife, first with coldness, and then
with cruelty. At length comes the dreadful and
dramatic scene that readers of the story will never
erase from their memories. In a fit of drunken
savagery he burst into her room at midnight. He
drags her from her bed; pushes her down the stairs
and along the hall; and then, opening the front
door, he hurls her by sheer brute force out into the
street. Here is George Eliot's picture: '<i>The stony
street; the bitter north-east wind and darkness; and
in the midst of them a tender woman thrust out
from her husband's home in her thin nightdress, the
harsh wind cutting her naked feet and driving her
long hair away from her half-clad bosom, where the
poor heart is crushed with anguish and despair.</i>'
It is in these desperate straits that religion presents
itself to her view in an entirely fresh guise.
</p>

<p>
In her extremity, poor Janet thinks of little Mrs.
Pettifer--a member of that other group, the group
that resembles the lilies under my window, the group
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of kindly souls whose lives have been irradiated and
beautified by their faith. She taps at the cottage
window; Mrs. Pettifer hastens to the door; and, as
soon as that frightened little body can recover from
the first shock of her astonishment, she draws Janet
into the room and then into the warm bed. Having
composed and soothed her, she slips out of bed
again, lights the fire and makes a cup of tea. In
<i>this</i> guise, religion presents itself to Janet!
</p>

<p>
But she needs more! A roof to shelter her, a
fire to warm her and a friend to caress and mother
her--these are very welcome; but her heart is crying
out with a yet deeper hunger. She feels that
she, a poor weak woman, is standing against a world
that is too hard and too strong and too terrible for
her. What can she do? Where can she go? Little
Mrs. Pettifer urges her to open her heart to Mr.
Tryan, the minister; and to Mr. Tryan she accordingly
goes. And in Mr. Tryan she finds ready helpfulness,
warm sympathy, and a perfect understanding
of her inmost need. Her life, she feels, is but
a tangled skein. To convince her that he is no
stranger to such conditions, Mr. Tryan tells her of
his own struggles and distresses. He has not stood
aloof from the battle, looking on; he has been in the
thick of the fight--<i>and has been wounded</i>. She
feels for him, and, in feeling for him, becomes conscious
that the healing of her own hurt has already
begun. In <i>this</i> guise, religion presents itself to
Janet Dempster!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>
In the person of Mrs. Pettifer and in the person
of Mr. Tryan, religion became incarnate under the
eyes of poor Janet. In the person of Mrs. Pettifer
and in the person of Mr. Tryan, '<i>the word became
flesh</i>.'
</p>

<p>
But Janet still needs more! Mrs. Pettifer shelters
and soothes her <i>body</i>; Mr. Tryan comforts and
strengthens her <i>mind</i>; but her <i>soul</i>, her very <i>self</i>,
what is she to do with <i>that</i>? She feels that she
cannot trust <i>herself</i> with <i>herself</i>. Is there no still
greater incarnation of the faith?
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pettifer is the <i>Incarnation Motherly</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tryan is the <i>Incarnation Ministerial</i>.
</p>

<p>
But, in her heart of hearts, there is still a deep
and bitter cry. Mrs. Pettifer can comfort; she
cannot keep through all the days to come! Mr.
Tryan can counsel; he cannot guard from future
sins and sorrows! To whom can she commit herself?
It is from Mr. Tryan's lips that the answer
comes. The words fall upon her broken spirit, as
she herself tells us, like rain upon the mown grass:
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
'<i>COME UNTO ME, ALL YE THAT LABOR
AND ARE HEAVY-LADEN, AND I WILL
GIVE YOU REST!</i>'
</p></div>

<p>
And once more the solution is an incarnation!
When Janet's storm-beaten <i>body</i> needed fire and
food and shelter, religion became incarnate in the
person of Mrs. Pettifer. When Janet's distracted
<i>mind</i> needed counsel and guidance, religion became
incarnate in the person of Mr. Tryan. But when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Janet's sin-laden <i>soul</i> cried out for a Saviour Who
could deliver her from the stains of the past, and
keep her amidst the perils of the future, religion
became incarnate in the Person of the Son of God!
</p>

<p>
<i>The Incarnation Motherly!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The Incarnation Ministerial!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>The Incarnation Mediatorial!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>Come unto Me!</i>' the Saviour said. And Janet
came! She was a changed woman! '<i>A delicious
hope</i>,' George Eliot tells us, '<i>the hope of purification
and inward peace, had entered into Janet's soul, and
made it spring-time there as well as in the outer
world!</i>' '<i>She felt</i>,' we are told again, '<i>like a little
child whose hand is firmly grasped by its father, as
its frail limbs make their way over the rough
ground: if it should stumble, the father will not let
it go.</i>' She had opened her heart to the living Lord
as the living flowers open their petals to the glad
sunlight; and He had become the strength of her
life and her portion for ever. Temptation came,
fierce and sudden and terrible; but He was always
there and always able to deliver.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
In the correspondence with her publisher as to
whether or not the manuscript should be printed,
George Eliot assures him that the characters are
drawn from life. And, in the closing paragraph
of the story, she tells us that Janet--an old woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
whose once-black hair is now quite gray--is living
still. But Mr. Tryan, she says, is dead; and she
describes the simple gravestone in Milby churchyard.
'<i>But</i>,' she adds, '<i>there is another memorial of Edgar
Tryan, which bears a fuller record; it is Janet
Dempster, rescued from self-despair, strengthened
with Divine hopes, and now looking back on years
of purity and helpful labor. The man who has left
such a memorial behind him must have been one
whose heart beat with true compassion and whose
lips were moved by fervent faith.</i>' It is the last
sentence in the book; and every minister, as he
closes the covers and lays it aside, will covet for
himself some such incarnate monument. Only as a
preacher's preaching is '<i>made flesh</i>' in that way,
will it be understood and appreciated by the generations
following.

<h3>CATHERINE BOOTH'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Who that was in London on October 14, 1890, can
forget the extraordinary scenes that marked the
funeral of Catherine Booth? It was a day of universal
grief. The whole nation mourned. For Mrs.
Booth was one of the most striking personalities,
and one of the mightiest spiritual forces, of the
nineteenth century. To the piety of a Saint Teresa
she added the passion of a Josephine Butler, the
purposefulness of an Elizabeth Fry, and the practical
sagacity of a Frances Willard. The greatest in
the land revered her, trusted her, consulted her, deferred
to her. The letters that passed between
Catherine Booth and Queen Victoria are among the
most remarkable documents in the literature of correspondence.
Mr. Gladstone attached the greatest
weight to her judgment and convictions. Bishop
Lightfoot, one of the most distinguished scholars
of his time, has testified to the powerful influence
which she exerted over him. And, whilst the loftiest
among men honored her, the lowliest loved her.
</p>

<p>
Such strong lives have their secrets. Mrs. Booth
had hers. Her secret was a text. As a child she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
learned it by heart; as a girl she pinned her faith
to the promise it enshrined; amidst the stress and
strain of a stormy and eventful life she trusted it
implicitly; and, with all the tenacity of her keen,
clear intellect, she clung to it at the last. In the
standard <i>Life of Catherine Booth</i>--a huge work of
a thousand pages--four chapters are devoted to the
scenes at the deathbed. And then we read:
</p>

<p>
'The lips moved as though desiring to speak.
Unable, however, to do so, the dying woman
pointed to a wall-text, which had for a long time
been placed opposite to her, so that her eyes could
rest upon it.
</p>

<p>
MY GRACE<br/>
IS<br/>
SUFFICIENT FOR THEE<br/>
</p>

<p>
It was taken down and placed near her on the bed.
But it was no longer needed. The promise had
been completely fulfilled.'
</p>

<p>
'That,' said a speaker at one of the great Memorial
Meetings in London, some of which were
attended by many thousand people, 'that was her
text!' And, as so often happens, her text explains
her character.
</p>

<p>
For, considered apart from the text, the character
is an insoluble enigma. It is like a consequence
without a cause. I was talking a week or two ago
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
with an old man, who, in Australia's earlier days,
did a good deal of pioneering in the heart of the
bush.
</p>

<p>
'Once,' he told me, 'soon after I first came out,
I really thought that I had reached the end of everything.
I was hopelessly lost. My strength was
utterly exhausted. I had gone as far as I could go.
The country around me was flat and dry; my thirst
was a perfect agony; and my poor dog followed
at my heels, her tongue hanging out, and her sides
panting pitifully. We had not seen water for several
days. I sat down under a great gum-tree,
hoping that an hour's rest would bring me fresh
heart and new vigor. I must have fallen asleep.
When I awoke, Fan was standing near me, wagging
her tail. She seemed contented and satisfied; her
tongue no longer protruded. An hour or two later,
I suddenly missed her; she had vanished in the
scrub. She was away about twenty minutes. I
determined to watch her. Presently she set out
again, and I followed. Surely enough, she had
found a tiny spring in a slight hollow about half a
mile away; and by that spring we were saved.'
</p>

<p>
I have seen something like this in a higher realm.
I recall, for example, Richard Cecil's story of his
conversion. Richard Cecil--the friend and biographer
of John Newton--was one of the great evangelical
forces of the <i>eighteenth</i> century, as Catherine
Booth was of the <i>nineteenth</i>. But, in his early days,
Richard Cecil was a skeptic.  He called himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
an infidel, but he was honest in his infidelity.
He could face facts; and the man who can look
facts fairly in the face is not far from the kingdom
of God. Richard Cecil was not, his skepticism notwithstanding.
'I see,' he says, in telling us of the
line of thought that he pursued as he lay in bed
one night, 'I see two unquestionable facts.' And
what were they? They both concerned his mother.
</p>

<p>
'<i>First</i>, my mother is greatly afflicted in circumstances,
body and mind; and I see that she cheerfully
bears up under all her suffering by the support
that she derives from constantly retiring to her
quiet room and her Bible.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Second</i>, my mother has a secret spring of comfort
of which I know nothing; while I, who give
an unbounded loose to my appetites, and seek
pleasure by every means, seldom or never find it.
If, however, there is any such secret in religion,
why may I not attain to it as well as my mother?
I will immediately seek it!'
</p>

<p>
He did; and those who are familiar with his life-story
know of the triumphant result of that quest.
It was precisely so with Mrs. Booth. Her children
knew that, like the bushman's collie, she found refreshment
at some secret spring. Later on, she told
them of the text and led them, one by one, to the
fountains of grace. '<i>My grace is sufficient for thee.</i>'
And when, at last, the avenues of speech and hearing
were closed, they hung the golden words before
her clouding eyes. Again she greeted them with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
rapture, and, with unwavering confidence, pointed
her children to their deathless message.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
In his <i>Grace Abounding</i>, John Bunyan tells us
that there was a period in his spiritual history when
his soul was like a pair of scales. It partook of
three phases. At one time the right-hand balance
was down and the left-hand empty and high; then
for awhile they were exactly and evenly poised; and,
at the last, the left-hand balance dropped and that
on the right-hand was swinging in the air.
</p>

<p>
At the <i>first</i> of these stages he was being tormented
about the unpardonable sin. He reminded himself
that, for Esau, there was no place for repentance;
and he felt that there was none for him. The scale
in which he laid his despair was heavily weighted;
the scale in which he placed his hope was empty!
</p>

<p>
And the <i>second</i> stage--the stage that leveled the
balances? 'One morning,' he says, 'as I was at
prayer, and trembling with fear, lest there should
be no word of God to help me, that piece of a sentence
darted in upon me: <i>My grace is sufficient!</i>
At this I felt some stay as if there might yet be hope.
About a fortnight before, I had been looking at this
very scripture, but I then thought that it could bring
me no comfort, and I threw down the book in a pet.
I thought that the grace was not large enough for
me! no, not large enough! But now it was as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
the arms of grace were so wide that they could enclose
not only me but many more besides. And so
<i>this</i> about the sufficiency of grace and <i>that</i> about
Esau finding no place for repentance would be like
a pair of scales within my mind. Sometimes one
end would be uppermost and sometimes again the
other; according to which would be my peace or
trouble.'
</p>

<p>
And the <i>third</i> stage--the triumphant stage?
Bunyan felt that the scales were merely level because,
in the balance that contained the hope, he had
thrown only four of the six words that make up the
text. '<i>My grace is sufficient</i>'; he had no doubt about
that, and it gave him encouragement. But '<i>for thee</i>';
he felt that, if only he could add those words to
the others, it would turn the scales completely. 'I
had hope,' he says, 'yet because the "<i>for thee</i>" was
left out, I was not contented, but prayed to God
for <i>that</i> also. Wherefore, one day, when I was in
a meeting of God's people, full of sadness and terror,
these words did with great power suddenly
break in upon me; <i>My grace is sufficient for thee,
My grace is sufficient for thee, My grace is sufficient
for thee</i>, three times together. And oh! methought
that every word was a mighty word unto
me; as <i>My</i> and <i>grace</i>, and <i>sufficient</i>, and <i>for thee</i>;
they were then, and sometimes are still, far bigger
than all others. Then, at last, that about Esau finding
no place for repentance began to wax weak and
withdraw and vanish, and this about the sufficiency
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of grace prevailed with peace and joy.' And so
the issue was reversed; the scale that held the hope
overweighed completely the scale that held the
despair.
</p>

<p>
If it were not that others have passed through
an identically similar experience, we should feel inclined
to marvel at Bunyan's reluctance to cast into
the balances the tail of the text: <i>My grace is sufficient--for
thee!</i> It seems strange, I say, that
Bunyan should have grasped with such confidence
the <i>four</i> words and then boggled at the other <i>two</i>.
And yet it is always easier to believe that there is a
Saviour for the world than to believe that there is a
Saviour <i>for me</i>. It is easy to believe that
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is grace enough for thousands<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Of new worlds as great as this;<br/></span>
<span class="i0">There is room for fresh creations<br/></span>
<span class="i2">In that upper home of bliss;<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
but it is much harder to believe that there is grace
and room <i>for me</i>. Martin Luther believed implicitly
and preached confidently that Christ died
for all mankind, long before he could persuade himself
that Christ died for Martin Luther. John
Wesley crossed the Atlantic that he might proclaim
the forgiveness of sins to the Indians; but it was
not until he was verging upon middle life that he
realized the possibility of the forgiveness of his
own.
</p>

<p>
It is all very illogical, of course, and very absurd.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
If we can accept the <i>four</i> words, why not accept
all <i>six</i>? If we credit the head of the text, why cavil
at the tail? Sometimes the absurdity of such irrational
behavior will break upon a man and set
him laughing at his own stupidity. Mr. Spurgeon
had some such experience. 'Gentlemen,' he said,
one Friday afternoon, in an address to his students,
'Gentlemen, there are many passages of Scripture
which you will never understand until some trying
or singular experience shall interpret them to you.
The other evening I was riding home after a heavy
day's work; I was very wearied and sore depressed;
and, swiftly and suddenly as a lightning flash, that
text laid hold on me: <i>My grace is sufficient for
thee!</i>  On reaching home, I looked it up in the
original, and at last it came to me in this way.
<span class="smcap">My</span> <i>grace is sufficient for</i>
<span class="smcap">Thee</span>! "Why," I said
to myself, "I should think it is!" and I burst out
laughing. I never fully understood what the holy
laughter of Abraham was like until then. It seemed
to make unbelief so absurd. It was as though some
little fish, being very thirsty, was troubled about
drinking the river dry; and Father Thames said:
"Drink away, little fish, my stream is sufficient for
thee!" Or as if a little mouse in the granaries of
Egypt, after seven years of plenty, feared lest it
should die of famine, and Joseph said: "Cheer up,
little mouse, my granaries are sufficient for thee!"
Again I imagined a man away up yonder on the
mountain saying to himself: "I fear I shall exhaust
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
all the oxygen in the atmosphere." But the earth
cries: "Breathe away, O man, and fill thy lungs;
my atmosphere is sufficient for thee!"' John Bunyan
enjoyed a moment's merriment of the same
kind when he threw the last two words into the
scale and saw his despair dwindle into insignificance
on the instant.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Some such thought shines through the passage
in which Paul tells us how the great words came to
him. He was irritated by his thorn; he prayed repeatedly
for its removal; but the only answer that
he received was this: <i>My grace is sufficient for
thee!</i> Grace sufficient for a thorn! It is an almost
ludicrous association of ideas!
</p>

<p>
It is so easy for Bunyan to believe that the divine
grace is sufficient for the wide, wide world; it is
so difficult to realize that it is sufficient for him!
</p>

<p>
It is so easy for Wesley to believe in the forgiveness
of sins: it is so difficult for him to believe in the
forgiveness of his own!
</p>

<p>
It is so easy for Paul to believe in the grace that
is sufficient to redeem a fallen race: it is so difficult
for him to believe in the grace that can fortify
him to endure his thorn!
</p>

<p>
And yet, in a fine essay on <i>Great Principles and
Small Duties</i>, Dr. James Martineau has shown that
it is the lowliest who most need the loftiest; it is
the tiny thorn that calls for the most tremendous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
grace. The gravest mistake ever made by educationalists
is, he says, the mistake of supposing that
those who know little are good enough to teach
those who know less. It is a tragedy, he declares,
when the master is only one stage ahead of his
pupil. 'The ripest scholarship,' he maintains, 'is
alone qualified to instruct the most complete ignorance.'
Dr. Martineau goes on to show that a
soul occupied with great ideas best performs trivial
duties. And, coming to the supreme example of his
subject, he points out that 'it was the peculiarity of
the Saviour's greatness, not that he stooped to the
lowliest, but that, without stooping, he penetrated
to the humblest wants. He not simply stepped aside
to look at the most ignominious sorrows, but went
directly to them, and lived wholly in them; scattered
glorious miracles and sacred truths along
the hidden by-paths and in the mean recesses of
existence; serving the mendicant and the widow,
blessing the child, healing the leprosy of body and
of soul, and kneeling to wash even the traitor's feet.'
Here is a strange and marvelous and beautiful law!
The loftiest for the lowliest! The greatest grace
for the tiniest thorn!
</p>

<p>
Is it any wonder that, this being so, Paul felt
that his splinter positively shone? '<i>I will glory in
it</i>,' he cried, '<i>that the power of Christ may be billetted
upon me.</i>' He feels that his soul is like some
rural hamlet into which a powerful regiment has
marched. Every bed and barn is occupied by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
soldiers. Who would not be irritated by a splinter,
he asks, if the irritation leads to such an inrush of
divine power and grace? It is like the pain of the
oyster that is healed by a pearl.
</p>

<p>
And so, with Paul as with Bunyan, the grace
turns the scales. It is better to have the pain if
it brings the pearl. It is better to have a thorn in
the one balance if it brings such grace into the
opposite balance that one is better off <i>with</i> the
thorn than <i>without</i> it. Therein lies life's deepest
secret--the secret that Catherine Booth and John
Bunyan learned from the lips that unfolded it to
Paul. In <i>The Master's Violin</i>, Myrtle Reed tells
us the secret of the music that the old man's fingers
wooed from the Cremona. You have but to look
at the master, she says, and you will comprehend.
'There he stands, a stately figure, gray and rugged,
yet with a certain graciousness; simple, kindly, and
yet austere; one who had accepted his sorrow, and,
by some alchemy of the spirit, transmuted it into
universal compassion, to speak, through the Cremona,
to all who could understand!'
</p>

<p>
<i>That</i> is the secret--the old musician's secret;
Catherine Booth's secret; Bunyan's secret; Paul's
secret; the secret of all who have learned the text
<i>by heart</i>!
</p>

<p>
<i>My grace is sufficient for thee</i>--the inrush of the
grace turned Paul's torturing splinter into a cause
for life-long thankfulness!
</p>

<p>
<i>My grace is sufficient for thee</i>--the inrush of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
grace turned Mrs. Booth's fierce struggle into a
ceaseless song!
</p>

<p>
<i>My grace is sufficient for thee!</i> To the man who
like John Bunyan, stands weighing his gladnesses
and sadnesses with that text in his mind, it will
seem that the one scale is overflowing and the other
empty. For it is the glory of the grace that it takes
what sadnesses there are and transmutes them into
songs sublime.

<h3>UNCLE TOM'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Poor old Uncle Tom has been stripped of everything.
All that he counted precious has vanished.
He has been torn away from the old Kentucky
home; has been snatched away from the arms of
old Aunt Chloe; has been sold away from children
and kindred; and has fallen into the merciless hands
of that vicious slave-dealer, Simon Legree. And now
Uncle Tom is dying. He lies in the dusty shed, his
back all torn and lacerated by the cruel thongs. All
through the night there steal to his side the other
slaves on the plantation, poor creatures who creep
in to see the last of him, to bathe his wounds, to
ask his pardon, or to kneel in prayer beside his
tortured frame. With the morning light comes
George Shelby, his old master, to redeem him.
</p>

<p>
'Is it possible, is it possible?' he exclaims, kneeling
down by the old slave. 'Uncle Tom, my poor,
poor old friend!'
</p>

<p>
But Uncle Tom is too far gone. He only murmurs
faintly to himself:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus can make a dying bed<br/></span>
<span class="i0">Feel soft as downy pillows are.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>
'You shan't die; you mustn't die, nor think of
it! I've come to buy you and take you home!' cries
George, with impetuous vehemence.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mas'r George, ye're too late. The Lord's
bought me and is going to take me home--and I
long to go. Heaven is better than old Kentucky!'
</p>

<p>
At this moment the sudden flush of strength
which the joy of meeting his young master had infused
into the dying man gives way. A sudden
sinking falls upon him; he closes his eyes; and
that mysterious and sublime change passes over
his face that suggests the approach of other
worlds. He begins to draw his breath with long,
deep inspirations, and his broad chest rises and falls
heavily. The expression of his face is that of a
conqueror.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Who</i>,' he murmurs, '<i>who--who--who shall
separate us from the love of Christ?</i>' And, with
that unanswerable challenge upon his quivering lips,
he falls into his last long sleep. Severed from all
that is dear to him, there is yet One heart from
which nothing can separate him. And in that indissoluble
tie he finds strong consolation at the last.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
I was speaking the other day to a lady who had
known Signor Alessandro Gavazzi. 'When he was
in England,' she told me, 'he used to come and stay
at my father's home, and, to us girls, he seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
like a visitor from another world.' The life of
Gavazzi is one of the stirring romances of the nineteenth
century. Born at Bologna in 1809, he became,
at the age of fifteen, a Barnabite monk. His
eloquence, even in his teens, was so extraordinary
that, at twenty, he was made Professor of Rhetoric
in the College of Naples. Some years afterward
Pope Pius the Ninth sent him on a special mission
to Milan as Chaplain-General to the Patriotic
Legion. A little later, however, a new light broke
upon him. He left the church of his fathers and
devoted his distinguished gifts to the work of evangelism.
In connection with his conversion, a
pathetic incident occurred. A superstitious Italian
mother will sometimes hang a charm around her
boy's neck to drive away malignant powers. When
Gavazzi was but a baby, his mother placed a locket
on his breast, and he never moved without it. But
when, in riper years, he found the Saviour, his
mother's gift caused him great perplexity. As a
charm he had no faith in it; he relied entirely on
the grace of his Lord to sustain and protect him.
And yet, for his mother's sake, he felt that he should
like to wear it. He solved the problem by placing
in the locket the words by which he had been led
to Christ. When he died, an old man of eighty, the
locket was found next his skin. And, when they
opened it, they read: '<i>Who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? I am persuaded that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God, which
is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i>' Gavazzi's excommunication
nearly broke his heart. He left Rome
to wander in strange lands, the most frightful anathemas
and maledictions ringing in his ears. He
was an exile and an outcast, shuddering under the
curse of the church that he had served so devotedly
and so long. Yet, after all, what did it matter?
He had found a love--the love of Christ--that he
had never known before; and from that all-compensating
love no power in church or state, in heaven
or earth, in time or in eternity, had power to tear
him.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
One is tempted to continue in this strain. It
would be pleasant to speak of Hugh Kennedy, of
Savonarola, and of others who found life and grace
and inspiration in the text on which poor Uncle
Tom pillowed his dying head. The testimony of
such witnesses is strangely fascinating; their name
is legion; we may yet cite one or two of them before
we close. Meanwhile, we must pay some attention
to the words of which they speak so rapturously.
And even to glance at them is to fall in love with
them. They are among the most stately, the most
splendid, in all literature. Macaulay, who read
everything, once found himself in Scotland on a fast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
day. It was a new experience for him, and he did
not altogether enjoy it. 'The place,' he said, 'had
all the appearance of a Puritan Sunday. Every
shop was shut and every church open. I heard the
worst and longest sermon that I ever remember.
Every sentence was repeated three or four times
over, and nothing in any sentence deserved to be
said once. I withdrew my attention and read the
Epistle to the Romans. I was much struck by the
eloquence and force of some passages, and made out
the connection and argument of some others which
had formerly seemed to me unmeaning. I enjoyed
the "<i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</i>"
I know few things finer.'
</p>

<p>
The words constitute themselves the greatest
challenge ever uttered. Poets and painters
have gloried in the conception of Ajax, on his
lonely rock, defying all the gods that be. But
what is <i>that</i> compared with <i>this</i>? In the passage
whose sublimities awoke the enthusiasm of Macaulay,
and delivered him from insufferable boredom,
Paul claims to have reached the limits of
finality, and he hurls defiance at all the forces of
futurity.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
Death? Life? Angels? Principalities? Powers?
Things Present? Things to Come? Height?
Depth? Any fresh Creation? I am persuaded that
none of them can separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</i>'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
Neither death nor life can do it. Not death--nor
even life. Both are formidable forces; and Paul
knew which was the more dangerous of the two.
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he died for his faith. That is fine--<br/></span>
<span class="i2">More than most of us do.<br/></span>
<span class="i0">But, say, can you add to that line<br/></span>
<span class="i2">That he lived for it, too?<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
When Elizabeth came to the English throne, a number
of men and women, who were awaiting martyrdom
under Mary, were liberated. Animated by the
spirit of Ridley and Latimer, they would have kissed
the faggots and embraced the stake. Yet, in the
years that followed, some of them lapsed into indifference,
went the way of the world, and named
the name of Christ no more. The ordeal of life
proved more potent and more terrible than the
ordeal of a fiery death.
</p>

<p>
Bunyan had learned that lesson. When he was
in the depths of his despair, envying the beasts
and birds about him, and tormenting himself with
visions of hell-fire, he went one day to hear a sermon
on the love of Christ. To use his own words,
his 'comforting time was come.' 'I began,' he says,
'to give place to the word which with power did
over and over again make this joyful sound within
my soul: "<i>Who shall separate me from the love of
Christ?</i>" And with that my heart was filled full of
comfort and hope, and I could believe that my sins
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
would be forgiven me. Yea, I was so taken with
the love and mercy of God that I remember that I
could not tell how to contain till I got home; I
thought I could have spoken of His love to the very
crows that sat upon the ploughed lands before me.
Surely I will not forget this forty years hence?'
</p>

<p>
Forty years hence! Forty years hence Bunyan
was sleeping in his quiet grave in Bunhill Fields;
and nobody who visits that familiar resting-place
of his supposes for a moment that <i>death</i> has separated
him from the love of Christ.
</p>

<p>
But <i>life</i>! Life is a far more dangerous foe.
'The tempter,' Bunyan tells us, 'would come upon
me with such discouragements as these: "You are
very hot for mercy, but I will cool you. This frame
shall not last. Many have been as hot as you for a
spirit, but I have quenched their zeal." With this,
several, who were fallen off, would be set before
mine eyes. Then I would be afraid that I should
fall away, too, but, thought I, I will watch and take
care. "Though you do," said the tempter, "I shall
be too hard for you. I will cool you insensibly, by
degrees, by little and little. Continual rocking will
lull a crying child to sleep. I shall have you cold
before long!" These things,' Bunyan continues,
'brought me into great straits. I feared that time
would wear from my mind my sense of the evil of
sin, of the worth of heaven, and of my need of the
blood of Christ.' But at that critical moment a text
came to his help--Uncle Tom's text, Signor Gavazzi's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
text. '<i>What shall separate us from the love
of Christ? For I am persuaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</i>' 'That,' Bunyan says, 'was a good
word to me.'
</p>

<p>
Death cannot do it!--that is good!
</p>

<p>
Life cannot do it!--that is better!
</p>

<p>
'And now I hoped,' says Bunyan, in concluding
his narrative of this experience, 'now I hoped that
long life would not destroy me nor make me miss
of heaven.'
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
Paul dares the universe. He defies infinity. He
summons, in pairs, all the powers that be, and
glories in their impotence to dissolve the sacred tie
that binds him to his Lord.
</p>

<p>
He calls <i>Life and Death</i> before him and dares
them to do it!
</p>

<p>
He calls the <i>Powers of this World</i> and the
<i>Powers of Every Other</i>; none of them, he says,
can do it!
</p>

<p>
He calls the <i>Things of the Historic Present</i> and
the <i>Developments of the Boundless Future</i>. Whatever
changes may come with the pageant of the
ages, there is one dear relationship that nothing can
ever affect!
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>
He calls the <i>Things in the Heights</i> and the <i>Things
in the Depths</i>; but neither among angels nor devils
can he discover any force that makes his faith to
falter!
</p>

<p>
He surveys <i>this Creation</i> and he contemplates
<i>the Possibility of Others</i>; but it is with a smile of
confidence and triumph.
</p>

<p>
'<i>For I am persuaded</i>,' he says, '<i>that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</i>'
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
The covenanters knew the value of Uncle Tom's
text. Among the heroic records of Scotland's terrible
ordeal, nothing is more impressive or affecting
than the desperate way in which persecuted men and
women clung with both hands to the golden hope
enshrined in that majestic word. It was in a Scottish
kirk that Macaulay discovered its splendor;
but even Macaulay failed to see in it all that <i>they</i>
saw.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful May morning when Major
Windram rode into Wigton and demanded the surrender,
to him and his soldiers, of two women who
had been convicted of attending a conventicle. One
of them was Margaret Wilson, a fair young girl
of eighteen. She was condemned to be lashed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
a stake at low tide in such a way that the rising
waters would slowly overwhelm her. In hope of
shaking her fidelity, and saving her life, it was
ordained that her companion should be fastened to
a stake a little farther out. 'It may be,' said her
persecutors, 'that, as Mistress Margaret watches
the waves go over the widow before her, she will
relent!' The ruse, however, had the opposite effect.
When Margaret saw the fortitude with which the
elder woman yielded her soul to the incoming tide,
she began to sing a paraphrase of the twenty-fifth
Psalm, and those on the beach took up the strain.
The soldiers angrily silenced them, and Margaret's
mother, rushing into the waters, begged her to save
her life by making the declaration that the authorities
desired. But tantalized and tormented, she
never flinched; and, as the waves lapped her face she
was heard to repeat, again and again, the triumphant
words: '<i>I am persuaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to
separate us from the love of God which is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</i>'
</p>

<p>
As a representative of the <i>men</i> of that stern time,
we may cite John Bruce. When that sturdy veteran,
after a long life of faithful testimony and incessant
suffering, lay dying, he beckoned his daughter to
the chair beside his bed. He told her, in broken
sentences and failing voice, of the goodness and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
mercy that had followed him all the days of his life;
and then, pausing suddenly, he exclaimed: 'Hark,
lass, the Master calls! Fetch the Buik!' She
brought the Bible to his side. 'Turn,' he said, 'to
the eighth of Romans and put my finger on these
words: "<i>Who can separate us from the love of
Christ? For I am persuaded that neither death, nor
life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor
depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate
us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.</i>" Now,' he continued, as soon as she had
found the place, 'put my finger on the words and
hold it there!' And with his finger there, pointing
even in death to the ground of all his confidence,
the old man passed away.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</i>'
asked Uncle Tom, with his last breath.
</p>

<p>
'Massa George sat fixed with solemn awe,' says
Mrs. Beecher Stowe, in continuing the story. 'It
seemed to him that the place was holy; and as he
closed Tom's lifeless eyes, and rose to leave the
dead, only one thought possessed him--What a
thing it is to be a Christian!'
</p>

<p>
It is indeed!

<h3>ANDREW BONAR'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
It is an old-fashioned Scottish kirk--and the Communion
Sabbath. Everybody knows of the hush
that brooded over a Scottish community a century
ago whenever the Communion season came round.
The entire population gave itself up to a period of
holy awe and solemn gladness. As the day drew
near, nothing else was thought about or spoken of.
At the kirk itself, day after day was given up to
preparatory exercises, fast-time sermons and the
fencing of tables. In this old kirk, in which we this
morning find ourselves, all these preliminaries are
past. The young people who are presenting themselves
for the first time have been duly examined by
the grave and somber elders, and, having survived
that fiery and searching ordeal, have received their
tokens. And now everything is ready. The great
day has actually come. The snowy cloths drape
the pews; everything is in readiness for the solemn
festival; the people come from far and near. But
I am not concerned with those who, on this impressive
and memorable occasion, throng around the
table and partake of the sacred mysteries. For, at
the back of the kirk, high up, is a cavernous and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
apparently empty old gallery, dark and dismal. Is
it empty? What is that patch of paleness that I see
up in the corner? Is it a face? It is! It is the
grave and eager face of a small boy; a face overspread
with awe and wonder as he gazes upon the
affecting and impressive scene that is being enacted
below. 'As a child,' said Dr. Bonar, many years
afterwards, when addressing the little people of his
own congregation, 'as a child I used to love to creep
up into that old gallery on Communion Sabbaths.
How I trembled as I climbed up the stairs! And
how I shuddered when the minister entered and
began the service! When I saw young people of my
own acquaintance take the holy emblems for the first
time, I wondered if, one great and beautiful day, I
should myself be found among the communicants.
But the thought always died in the moment of its
birth. For I found in my heart so much that must
keep me from the love of Christ. I thought, as I
sat in the deep recesses of that gloomy old gallery,
that I must purge my soul of all defilement, and cultivate
all the graces of the faith, before I could hope
for a place in the Kingdom of Christ or venture as
a humble guest to His table. But oh, how I longed
one day to be numbered among that happy company!
I thought no privilege on earth could compare with
that.'

<p>
A couple of entries in his diary will complete our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
preparation for the record of the day that changed
his life. He is a youth of nineteen, staid and
thoughtful, but full of life and merriment, and the
popular center of a group of student friends.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 3, 1829.</i>--Great sorrow, because I am still
out of Christ.
</p>

<p>
<i>May 31, 1829.</i>--My birthday is past and I am
not born again.
</p>

<p>
Not every day, I fancy, do such entries find their
way into the confidential journals of young people
of nineteen.
</p>

<p>
God's flowers are all everlastings. The night may
enfold them; the grass may conceal them; the snows
may entomb them; but they are always there. They
do not perish or fade. See how the principle works
out in history! There is no more remarkable revival
of religion in our national story than that represented
by the Rise of the Puritans. The face of
England was changed; everything was made anew.
Then came the Restoration. Paradise was lost.
Puritanism vanished as suddenly as it had arisen.
But was it dead? Professor James Stalker, in a
Centennial Lecture on Robert Murray McCheyne--a
name that stands imperishably associated with that
of Andrew Bonar--says most emphatically that it
was not. He shows how, like a forest fire, the
movement swept across Europe, returning at last to
the land in which it rose. When, with the Restoration,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
England relapsed into folly, it passed over into
Holland, preparing for us, among other things, a
new and better line of English kings. From Holland
it passed into Germany, and, by means of the Moravian
Brethren, produced the most amazing missionary
movement of all time. From Germany it returned
to England, giving us the Methodist Revival
of the eighteenth century, a revival which, according
to Lecky, alone saved England from the horrors of
an industrial revolution. And from England it
swept into Scotland, and kindled there such a revival
of religion as has left an indelible impression upon
Scottish life and character. It was in the sweep of
that historic movement that the soul of Andrew
Bonar was born.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
'It was in 1830,' he says, in a letter to his brother,
written in his eighty-third year, 'it was in 1830 that
I found the Saviour, or rather, that He found me,
and laid me on His shoulders rejoicing.' And how
did it all come about? It was a tranquil evening in
the early autumn, and a Sabbath. There is always
something conducive to contemplation about an
autumn evening. When, one of these days, one of
our philosophers gives us a <i>Psychology of the Seasons</i>,
I shall confidently expect to find that the great
majority of conversions take place in the autumn.
At any rate, Andrew Bonar's did. As he looked out
upon the world in the early morning, he saw the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
shrubs in the garden below him, and the furze on
the moorland beyond, twinkling with the dew-drenched
webs of innumerable spiders. In his walk
to the church, and in a stroll across the fields in the
afternoon, the hush of the earth, broken only by the
lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep and the rustle
of the leaves that had already fallen, saturated his
spirit. The world, he thought, had never looked so
beautiful. The forest was a riot of russet and gold.
The hedge-rows were bronze and purple and saffron.
The soft and misty sunlight only accentuated the
amber tints that marked the dying fern. In the
evening, unable to shake off the pensive mood into
which the day had thrown him, he reached down
Guthrie's <i>Trial of a Saving Interest in Christ</i>, and
gave himself to serious thought. Was it in the pages
of Guthrie's searching volume that he came upon the
text, or did he, later on, lay down the book and take
up his New Testament instead? I do not know.
But, however that may have been, one great and
glowing thought took complete possession of his
soul. As the tide will sometimes rush suddenly up
the sands, filling up every hollow and bearing away
all the seaweed and driftwood that has been lying
there so long, so one surging and overmastering
word poured itself suddenly in upon his mind, bearing
away with it the doubts and apprehensions that
had tormented him for years. '<i>Of His fullness have
we all received, and grace for grace.</i>' Then and
there, he says, he began to have a secret joyful hope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
that he did really believe on the Lord Jesus. 'The
fullness and freeness of the divine grace filled my
heart; I did nothing but receive!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>His fullness filled my heart!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I did nothing but receive!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Forty-two years afterwards, at the age of sixty-two,
he revisited that room and tried to recapture the
holy ecstasy with which, so many years earlier, he
had 'first realized a found Saviour.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Grace for grace!</i>'
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace!</i>'
</p>

<p>
I know a fair Australian city that nestles serenely
at the foot of a tall and massive mountain. Half
way up the slopes is the city's reservoir. In a
glorious and evergreen valley it has been hollowed
out of the rugged mountain-side. The virgin bush
surrounds it on every hand; at its western extremity
a graceful waterfall comes pouring down from the
heights, mingling its silvery music with the songs
of the birds around. It is the favorite haunt of
gaily-colored kingfishers. Swallows skim hither
and thither over its crystalline and placid surface;
and, as if kissing their own reflections in the glass,
they just touch the water as they flit across, creating
circles that grow and grow until they reach the
utmost edge. Like a giant who, conscious of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
grandeur, loves to see his image in the mirror, the
scarped and weather-beaten summit gazes sternly
down from above and sees his splendors reproduced,
and even enhanced, in the limpid depths below.
Often, on a hot day, have I resorted to this sylvan
retreat. At this altitude, how deliciously cool is the
air; how icy cold the water! It has come pouring
down the cataract from the melting snows above!
For, strangely enough, the winter rains and the summer
suns conspire to keep it always full. Far down
the mountain-side I see the city, shimmering in the
noonday heat. I think of its population, hot, tired
and thirsty. And then it pleases me to reflect that
every house down there at the mountain's foot is in
direct communication with this vast basin of shining
water. The people have but to stretch forth their
hands and replenish their vessels again and again.
This crystal reservoir far up the slopes is really a
part of the furniture of each of those homes. Have
not I myself been down there in the dust and heat
on such a day as this? Have not I myself been
parched and thirsty? And have I not thought wistfully
of the reservoir far up the slopes? And have
I not taken my glass and filled it and quaffed with
relish the sweet and sparkling water? And have I
not said to myself, as I thought of the familiar
scene among the hills: 'Of its fullness have all we
received, and water for water.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>His fullness filled my heart!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I did nothing but receive!</i>'
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace!</i>'
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Yes, grace for grace! Grace for manhood following
upon grace for youth! Grace for sickness following
upon grace for health! Grace for sorrow
following upon grace for joy! Grace for age following
upon grace for maturity! Grace to die following
upon grace to live! Of that fullness of which
he first drank on that lovely autumn evening, he
drank again and again and again, always with fresh
delight and satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-five years later, I find him saying that,
'if there is one thing for which I praise the Lord
more than another it is this: that He opened my eyes
to see that Christ pleases the Father to the full, and
that <i>this</i> is the ground of my acceptance.'
</p>

<p>
Five years later still, he says that 'I have been
many, many times unhappy for awhile, but have
never seriously doubted my interest in the Lord
Jesus.'
</p>

<p>
When he was fifty-four, his wife died, leaving
him to bring up his young family as best he could.
But '<i>grace for grace</i>.' A year or two later, I find
him rejoicing that 'to-night both Isabella and Marjory
came home speaking of their having been enabled
to rest on Christ. What a joyful time it has
been! I think, too, the young servant has found
Christ. Blessed Lord, I have asked Thee often to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
remember Thy promise, and "when mother leaves
thee, the Lord will take thee up." I have asked
Thee to be a mother to my motherless children, and
now, indeed, Thou hast given me my prayer. Praise,
praise for evermore!'
</p>

<p>
On the fiftieth anniversary of that never-to-be-forgotten
autumn evening, he records with gratitude
the fact that, 'for fifty years the Lord has kept me
within sight of the Cross.'
</p>

<p>
Ten years later still, now an old man of eighty,
he declares that his Saviour has never once left him
in the darkness all these years.
</p>

<p>
And, two years later, just before his death, he
writes, 'it was sixty-two years ago that I found the
Saviour, or, rather, that He found me; and I have
never parted company with Him all these years.
Christ the Saviour has been to me my true portion,
my heaven begun; and my earnest prayer and desire
for you and Mary and little Marjory will always be,
that you may each find, not only all I ever found in
Christ, but a hundredfold more, every year!'
</p>

<p>
<i>Grace for grace!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Grace for the father and grace for the children!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Grace for the old man just about to die, and grace
for the little child just learning how to live!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace!</i>'
</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>
Yes, <i>grace for grace</i>! Grace for the pulpit and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
grace for the pew!' For, through all these years,
Andrew Bonar was a minister, and the text was the
keynote of all his utterances.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fullness! Fullness! Fullness!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Receive! Receive! Receive!</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Grace for grace! Grace for grace!</i>
</p>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace!</i>'
</p>

<p>
In his study there hung a text of two words. He
had had it specially printed, for those two words expressed
the abiding fullness on which he loved to
dwell. '<i>Thou remainest!</i>' One day, we are told, a
lady in great sorrow called to see him. But nothing
that he said could comfort her. Then, suddenly, he
saw a light come into her face. 'Say no more,' she
said, 'I have found what I need!' and she pointed to
the text: '<i>Thou remainest!</i>'
</p>

<p>
That was it! Come what will, He abides! Go
who may, He remains! Amidst all the chances and
changes of life, He perennially satisfies. Like the
thirsty toilers in the city, I draw and draw again, and
am each time refreshed and revived.
</p>

<p>
'<i>His fullness fills my heart!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>I do nothing but receive!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Of His fullness have all we received, and grace
for grace!</i>'

<h3>FRANCIS D'ASSISI'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Oscar Wilde declares that, since Christ went to
the cross, the world has produced only one genuine
Christian, and his name is Francis d'Assisi. Certainly
he is the one saint whom all the churches have
agreed to canonize; the most vividly Christlike man
who has ever submitted his character to the scrutiny
of public criticism. His life, as Green says in his
<i>Short History of the English People</i>, his life falls
like a stream of light athwart the darkness of the
medi&aelig;val ages. Matthew Arnold speaks of him as
a figure of most magical potency and sweetness and
charm. Francis called men back to Christ and
brought Christ back to men. 'All Europe woke with
a start,' Sabatier affirms, 'and whatever was best
in humanity leaped to follow his footsteps.'
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
A blithe saint was Francis. He loved to laugh;
he loved to sing; and he loved to hear the music of
laughter and of song as it rippled from the lips of
others. Every description that has come down to us
lays stress on the sunshine that played about his lofty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
forehead and open countenance. The days came
when, though still in the heyday of early manhood,
his handsome figure was gaunt and wasted; his fine
face furrowed with suffering and care; his virile
strength exhausted by ceaseless toil, wearisome journeyings,
and exacting ministries of many kinds.
But, emaciated and worn, his face never for a
moment lost its radiance. He greeted life with a
cheer and took leave of it with a smile.
</p>

<p>
His youth was a frolic; his very sins were pleasant
sins. His winsomeness drew to him the noblest
youths and fairest maidens of Assisi. The lithe and
graceful figure of Francis, with his dark, eloquent
but sparkling eyes, his wealthy shock of jet black
hair, his soft, rich, sonorous voice and his gay but
faultless attire, was the soul and center of every
youthful revel. He was, as Sir James Stephen says,
foremost in every feat of arms, first in every triumph
of scholarship, and the gayest figure in every festival.
'The brightest eyes in Assisi, dazzled by so
many graces, and the most reverend brows there,
acknowledging such early wisdom, were alike bent
with admiration towards him; and all conspired to
sustain his father's confidence that, in his person,
the family name would rival the proudest and most
splendid in Italy's illustrious past.' His bewitching
personality, his rollicking gaiety, his brooding
thoughtfulness, his dauntless courage and his courtly
ways swept all men off their feet; he had but to
lead and they instinctively followed; he commanded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and they unquestionably obeyed. He was nick-named
<i>the Flower of Assisi</i>. He loved to be happy
and to make others happy. 'Yet,' as one Roman
Catholic biographer remarks, 'he did not yet know
where true happiness was to be found.' He was
twenty-four when he made that sensational discovery.
He found the source of true happiness in
the last place in the world in which he would have
thought of looking for it. He found it at the Cross!
And, in perfect consistency with his youthful conduct,
he spent the rest of his days--he died at forty-four--in
pointing men to the Crucified. As a youth
he had done his best to radiate laughter and song
among all the young people of Assisi; it was therefore
characteristic of him that, having discovered
the fountain-head of all abiding satisfaction, he
should make it the supreme object of his maturer
years to share his sublime secret with the whole
wide world.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
London was a village in the time of Francis
d'Assisi, and the baying of the wolves was the only
sound heard in the forests that then covered the sites
of our great modern cities. Whilst King John was
signing Magna Carta, Francis was at Rome seeking
recognition for his brotherhood of friars. It was
the age of the Crusaders and the Troubadours.
Yet, as I read the moving record of his great
spiritual experience, I forget that I have invaded a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
period in which English history had scarcely begun.
Francis has his affinities in every land and in every
age. Francis died four hundred years before John
Bunyan was born; yet, as I read Bunyan's description
of Christian at the Cross, I seem to be perusing
afresh the story of the conversion of Francis. The
language fits exactly. Strike out the word 'Christian,'
and substitute the word 'Francis,' and the
passage could be transferred bodily from the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> to the <i>Life of Francis d'Assisi</i>.
</p>

<p>
The conversion of Francis occurred five hundred
years before Dr. Watts wrote his noble hymn, '<i>When
I survey the wondrous Cross</i>'; yet, without knowing
the words, Francis sang that song in his heart over
and over and over again.
</p>

<p>
The conversion of Francis was effected six hundred
years before the conversion of Mr. Spurgeon.
Yet that conversion in the ruined church of St.
Damian's in Italy is the very counterpart of that
later conversion in the little chapel at Artillery
Street, Colchester.
</p>

<p>
'Look!' cried the preacher at Colchester, 'look to
Jesus! Look to Jesus!' 'I looked,' says Mr. Spurgeon;
'I looked and was saved!'
</p>

<p>
'Francis looked to the Crucified,' says his biographer.
'It was a look of faith; a look of love; a
look that had all his soul in it; a look which did not
attempt to analyze, but which was content to receive.
He looked, and, looking, entered into life.'
</p>

<p>
You can take the sentences from the <i>Life of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Francis</i> and transfer them to the <i>Life of Spurgeon</i>,
or vice versa, and they will fit their new environment
with the most perfect historical accuracy.
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
As, with your face towards Spello, you follow the
windings of the Via Francesca, you will find the
little church of St. Damian's on the slope of the
hill outside the city walls. It is reached by a few
minutes' walk over a stony path, shaded with olive-trees,
amid odors of lavender and rosemary. 'Standing
on the top of a hillock, the entire plain is visible
through a curtain of cypresses and pines which seem
to be trying to hide the humble hermitage and set up
an ideal barrier between it and the world.' Francis
was particularly fond of this wooded walk and of
the sanctuary to which it led. In pensive moments,
when it was more than usually evident to him that,
with all his merriment, he had not yet discovered the
fountain of true gladness, he turned his face this
way.
</p>

<p>
The crucifix at St. Damian's--which is still preserved
in the sacristy of Santa Chiara--has features
peculiarly its own. It differs from other images of
the kind: 'In most of the sanctuaries of the twelfth
century, the Crucified One, frightfully lacerated,
with bleeding wounds, appears to seek to inspire only
grief and compunction; that of St. Damian, on the
contrary, has an expression of unutterable calm and
gentleness; instead of closing the eyelids in eternal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
surrender to the weight of suffering, it looks down
in self-forgetfulness, and its pure, clear gaze says,
not "<i>See how I suffer!</i>" but "<i>Come unto Me!</i>"'
</p>

<p>
That, at any rate, is what it said to Francis on that
memorable day. With an empty and a hungry heart
he kneeled before it. 'O Lord Jesus,' he cried, 'shed
Thy light upon the darkness of my mind!' And
then an extraordinary thing happened. The Saviour
to whom he prayed was no longer an inanimate
image; but a living Person! 'An answer seemed
to come from the tender eyes that looked down on
him from the Cross,' says Canon Adderley. 'Jesus
heard his cry, and Francis accepted the dear Lord
as his Saviour and Master. A real spiritual union
took place between him and his Divine Lord. He
took Him for better for worse, for richer for poorer,
till death and after death, for ever.' 'This vision
marks,' Sabatier says, 'the final triumph of Francis.
His union with Christ is consummated; from this
time he can exclaim with the mystics of every age,
"My beloved is mine and I am His." From that day
the remembrance of the Crucified One, the thought
of the love which had triumphed in immolating
itself, became the very center of his religious life,
the soul of his soul. For the first time, Francis had
been brought into direct, personal, intimate contact
with Jesus Christ.' 'It was,' Canon Adderley says
again, 'no mere intellectual acceptance of a theological
proposition, but an actual self-committal to
the Person of Jesus; no mere sentimental feeling of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
pity for the sufferings of Christ, or of comfort in the
thought that, through those sufferings, he could secure
a place in a future heaven, but a real, brave
assumption of the Cross, an entering into the fellowship
of the Passion of Christ, a determination to
suffer with Him and to spend and be spent in His
service.'
</p>

<p>
Francis never forgot that moment. His whole
soul overflowed with the intensity of his affection
for his Saviour. To the end of his days he could
never think of the Cross without tears; yet he never
knew whether those tears were prompted by admiration,
pity, or desire.
</p>

<p>
When he arose and left the little sanctuary, he
felt, as Bunyan's pilgrim felt, that he had lost his
load, and lost it for ever.
</p>

<p>
But he felt that he had assumed another. He had
taken up the Cross. He had devoted himself to its
service. '<i>God forbid</i>,' he cried, '<i>that I should glory
save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom
the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.</i>'
When, five centuries later, Isaac Watts surveyed the
wondrous Cross on which the Prince of Glory died,
his contemplation led to the same resolve:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Save in the death of Christ my God!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">All the vain things that charm me most,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">I sacrifice them to His blood.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
And so, once more, without knowing the words,
Francis sang in his soul that song of consecration.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>
'<i>I looked and looked and looked again!</i>' say
Francis and Spurgeon, six centuries apart.
</p>

<p>
'<i>It was very surprising to me that the sight of
the Cross should thus ease me of my burden!</i>' say
Francis and Bunyan, with four centuries between.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast save in
the death of Christ my God!</i>' cry Francis and
Isaac Watts, undivided by a chasm of five hundred
years.
</p>

<p>
In the presence of the Cross all the lands are
united and all the ages seem as one.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
'<i>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross
of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is
crucified unto me and I unto the world.</i>' In the
one cross Francis saw--as Paul did--three crucifixions.
</p>

<p>
He saw on the Cross <i>his Lord crucified for him</i>.
</p>

<p>
He saw on the Cross <i>the world crucified to him</i>.
</p>

<p>
He saw on the Cross <i>himself crucified to the
world</i>.
</p>

<p>
From that hour Francis knew nothing among men
save Jesus Christ and Him crucified. Laying aside
the gay clothing of which he was so fond, he donned
a peasant's cloak and tied it at the waist with a piece
of cord--the garb that afterwards became the habit
of the Franciscan Order. He then set out to initiate
the greatest religious revival and the greatest missionary
movement of the medi&aelig;val ages--the enterprise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
that paved the way for the Renaissance and the
Reformation. Beginning at his native town, he journeyed
through the classic cities of Italy, unfolding
to all sorts and conditions of men the wonders of the
Cross. Although the hideous sight and loathsome
smell of leprosy had always filled him with unconquerable
disgust, he gladly ministered to the lepers,
in the hope that, by so doing, he might impart to
them the infinite consolations of the Cross. Worn
as he soon became, he set out to tramp from land to
land in order that he might proclaim through
Europe and Asia the matchless message of the Cross.
In his walks through the lonely woods he loved to
proclaim to the very birds the story of the Cross.
It is another link with Bunyan. Bunyan felt
that he should like to tell the crows on the ploughed
fields the story of his soul's salvation; but Francis
actually did it. He would sit down in the forest:
wait until the oaks and beeches and elms about him
were filled with sparrows and finches and wrens;
and then tell of the dying love of Him who made
them. And, as they flew away, he loved to fancy
that they formed themselves into a cross-shaped
cloud above him, and that the songs that they sang
were the rapt expression of their adoring worship.
In his long journeyings he was often compelled to
subsist on roots and nuts and berries. Meeting a
kindred spirit in the woods he one day suggested
that they should commune together. His companion
looked about him in bewilderment. But Francis
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
pointed to a rock. 'See!' he said, 'the rock shall be
our altar; the berries shall be our bread; the water
in the hollow of the rock shall be our wine!' It
took very little to turn the thoughts of Francis to the
Cross; he easily lifted his soul into communion with
the Crucified. Whenever and wherever Francis
opened his lips, the Cross was always his theme.
'He poured into my heart the sweetness of Christ!'
said his most eminent convert, and thousands could
have said the same. Feeling the magnitude of his
task and the meagerness of his powers, he called
upon his converts to assist him, and sent them out,
two by two, to tell of the ineffable grace of the
Cross. In humanness and common sense he founded
his famous Order. His followers were to respect
domestic ties; they were to regard all work as honorable,
and to return an equivalent in labor for all
that they received. They were to husband their own
powers; to regard their bodies as sacred, and on no
account to exhaust their energies in needless vigils
and fastings. The grey friars soon became familiar
figures in every town in Europe. They endured
every conceivable privation and dared every form of
danger in order that, like their founder, they might
tell of the deathless love of the Cross.
</p>

<p>
Francis himself did not live long to lead them;
but in death as in life his eyes were on the Cross.
Fifty of his disciples knelt around his bed at the last.
He begged them to read to him the 19th chapter of
John's gospel--the record of the Crucifixion. 'In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
living or in dying,' he said, '<i>God forbid that I should
glory save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ!</i>'
</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>
Francis d'Assisi and Matthew Arnold appear to
have little or nothing in common. Francis was emotional,
mystical, seraphic; Arnold was cultured, cold,
and critical. Yet Francis threw an extraordinary
spell over the scholarly mind of Arnold, and, dissimilar
as were their lives, in death they were not
divided.
</p>

<p>
'O my Lord Jesus,' prayed Francis, 'I beseech
Thee, grant me <i>two</i> graces before I die; the <i>first</i>,
that I may feel in my soul and in my body, as far as
may be, the pain that Thou, sweet Lord, didst bear
in the hours of Thy most bitter passion; the <i>second</i>,
that I may feel in my heart, as far as may be, that
exceeding love wherewith Thou, O Son of God,
didst willingly endure such agony for us sinners.'
</p>

<p>
His prayer was answered. As the sun was setting
on a lovely autumn evening, he passed away,
sharing the anguish, yet glorying in the triumph of
the Cross. The song of the birds to whom he had
so often preached flooded the air with the melody he
loved so well.
</p>

<p>
On another beautiful evening, nearly seven centuries
later, Matthew Arnold passed suddenly away.
It was a Sunday, and he was spending it with his
brother-in-law at Liverpool. In the morning they
went to Sefton Park Church. Dr. John Watson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
(Ian Maclaren) preached on <i>The Shadow of the
Cross</i>. He used an illustration borrowed from the
records of the Riviera earthquake. In one village,
he said, everything was overthrown but the huge
way-side crucifix, and to it the people, feeling the
very ground shuddering beneath their feet, rushed
for shelter and protection. After the sermon, most
of the members of the congregation remained for the
Communion; but Arnold went home. As he came
down to lunch, a servant heard him singing softly:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I survey the wondrous Cross<br/></span>
<span class="i2">On which the Prince of Glory died,<br/></span>
<span class="i0">My richest gain I count but loss,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">And pour contempt on all my pride.<br/></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">Save in the death of Christ my God!<br/></span>
<span class="i0">All the vain things that charm me most,<br/></span>
<span class="i2">I sacrifice them to His blood.<br/></span>
</div></div>

<p>
In the afternoon he went for a walk with his relatives.
He had, he told them, seldom been so deeply
impressed by a sermon as by Dr. Watson's. He particularly
mentioned the story of the Riviera crucifix.
'Yes,' he said, earnestly, 'the Cross remains, and, in
the straits of the soul, makes its ancient appeal.' An
hour later his heart had ceased to beat.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God forbid that I should glory save in the Cross!</i>'
cried Francis.
</p>

<p>
'<i>The Cross remains, and, in the straits of the soul,
makes its ancient appeal!</i>' exclaims Matthew Arnold.
</p>

<p>
For the Cross, as Francis discovered that great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
day, is the true source of all abiding happiness; the
Cross is the stairway that Jacob saw, leading up
from earth to heaven; the Cross has a charm for
men of every clime and every time; it is the boast
of the redeemed; the rock of ages; the hope of this
world and the glory of the world to come.

<h3>EVERYBODY'S TEXT</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
Centuries seemed like seconds that day: they
dwindled down to nothing. It was a beautiful September
morning: I was only a little boy: and, as a
great treat, my father and mother had taken me to
London to witness the erection of Cleopatra's
Needle. The happenings of that eventful day live
in my memory as vividly as though they had occurred
but yesterday. I seem even now to be watching
the great granite column, smothered with its
maze of hieroglyphics, as it slowly ascends from the
horizontal to the perpendicular, like a giant waking
and standing erect after his long, long sleep. All
the way up in the train we had been talking about
the wonderful thing I was so soon to see. My
father had told me that it once stood in front of
the great temple at Heliopolis; that the Pharaohs
drove past it repeatedly on their way to and from the
palace; and that, very possibly, Moses, as a boy of
my own age, sat on the steps at its base learning the
lessons that his tutor had prescribed. It seemed to
bring Moses and me very near together. To think
that he, too, had stood beside this self-same obelisk
and had puzzled over the weird inscriptions that
looked so bewildering to me! And now Heliopolis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the City of the Sun, has vanished! A single column
tells the traveler where it stood! London is the
world's metropolis to-day. And the monument, that
stood among the splendors of the <i>old</i> world, is being
re-erected amidst the glories of the <i>new</i>!
</p>

<p>
Will a time ever come, I wondered, when London
will be as Heliopolis is? Will the Needle, in some
future age, be erected in some new capital--in the
metropolis of To-morrow? Had you stood, three
thousand years ago, where St. Paul's now stands,
the only sound that you would have heard coming
up from the forests around would have been the
baying of the wolves. Wild swine ranged undisturbed
along the site of the Strand. But Egypt was
in her glory, and the Needle stood in front of the
temple! Where, I wonder, will it stand in three
thousand years' time? Some such thought must
have occurred to the authorities who are presiding
over its erection. For see, in the base of the obelisk
a huge cavity yawns! What is to be placed within
it? What greeting shall we send from the <i>Civilization-that-is</i>
to the <i>Civilization-that-is-to-be</i>? It is
a strange list upon which the officials have decided.
It includes a set of coins, some specimens of weights
and measures, some children's toys, a London directory,
a bundle of newspapers, the photographs of the
twelve most beautiful women of the period, a box of
hairpins and other articles of feminine adornment, a
razor, a parchment containing a translation of the
hieroglyphics on the obelisk itself--the hieroglyphics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that so puzzled Moses and me--and last, but
not least, <i>a text!</i> Yes, a text; and a text, not in one
language, but in every language known! The men
who tear down the obelisk from among the crumbling
ruins of London may not be able to decipher
this language, or that, or the other. But surely one
of these ten score of tongues will have a meaning
for them! And so, in the speech of these two hundred
and fifteen peoples, these words are written
out: <span class="smcap">For God so Loved the World that He Gave
His Only Begotten Son that Whosoever Believeth
in Him should not Perish but have
Everlasting Life</span>. <i>That</i> is the greeting which the
Twentieth Century sends to the Fiftieth! I do not
know what those men--the men who rummage
among the ruins of London--will make of the newspapers,
the parchments, the photographs and the
hairpins. I suspect that the children's toys will seem
strangely familiar to them: a little girl's doll was
found by the arch&aelig;ologists among the ruins of
Babylon: childhood keeps pretty much the same all
through the ages. But the text! The text will seem
to those far-off people as fresh as the latest fiftieth-century
sensation. Those stately cadences belong to
no particular time and to no particular clime. Ages
may come and go; empires may rise and fall; they
will still speak with fadeless charm to the hungry
hearts of men. They are for the Nations-that-were,
for the Nations-that-are, and for the Nations-yet-to-be.
That Text is <i>EVERYBODY'S TEXT</i>.
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
Few things are more arresting than the way in
which these tremendous words have won the hearts
of all kinds and conditions of men. I have been
reading lately the lives of some of our most eminent
evangelists and missionaries; and nothing has impressed
me more than the conspicuous part that this
text has played in their personal lives and public
ministries. Let me reach down a few of these
volumes.
</p>

<p>
Here is the <i>Life of Richard Weaver</i>. In the days
immediately preceding his conversion, Richard was
a drunken and dissolute coal miner. It is a rough,
almost repulsive, story. He tells us how, after his
revels and fights, he would go home to his mother
with bruised and bleeding face. She always received
him tenderly; bathed his wounds; helped him to bed;
and then murmured in his ear the words that at last
seemed inseparable from the sound of her voice:
<i>God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish but have everlasting life.</i> The words came
back to him in the hour of his greatest need. His
soul was passing through deep waters. Filled with
misery and shame, and terrified lest he should have
sinned beyond the possibility of salvation, he crept
into a disused sand-pit. He was engaged to fight
another man that day, but he was in death-grips
with a more terrible adversary. 'In that old sand-pit,'
he says, 'I had a battle with the devil; and I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
came off more than conqueror through Him that
loved me.' And it was the text that did it. As he
agonized there in the sand-pit, tormented by a thousand
doubts, his mother's text all at once spoke out
bravely. It left no room for uncertainty. '<i>God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten
Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.</i>' 'I thought,'
Richard tells us, 'that <i>whosoever</i> meant <i>me</i>. What
faith was, I could not tell; but I had heard that it
was taking God at His word; and so I took God at
His word and trusted in the finished work of my
Saviour. The happiness I then enjoyed I cannot
describe; my peace flowed as a river.'
</p>

<p>
Duncan Matheson and Richard Weaver were contemporaries.
They were born at about the same
time; and, at about the same time they were converted.
Matheson was Scottish; Weaver was English.
Matheson was a stonemason; Weaver was a
coal-miner; in due course both became evangelists.
In some respects they were as unlike each other as
two men could possibly be: in other respects their
lives are like sister ships; they seem exactly alike.
Especially do they resemble each other in their
earliest religious experiences. We have heard
Weaver's story: let us turn to Matheson's. Weaver,
at the time of his conversion, was twenty-five:
Matheson is twenty-two. He has been ill at ease
for some time, and every sermon he has heard has
only deepened his distress. On a sharp winter's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
morning, with the frost sparkling on the shrubs and
plants around him, he is standing in his father's garden,
when, suddenly, the words of Richard Weaver's
text--Everybody's Text--take powerful hold upon
his mind. 'I saw,' he says, 'that God loves me, for
God loves all the world. I saw the proof of His
love in the giving of His Son. I saw that <i>whosoever</i>
meant <i>me</i>, <i>even me</i>. My load was loosed from
off my back. Bunyan describes his pilgrim as giving
three leaps for joy as his burden rolled into the open
sepulchre. I could not contain myself for gladness.'
The parallel is very striking.
</p>

<p>
'<i>God loves me!</i>' <i>exclaims</i> Richard Weaver, in
surprise.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I saw that God loves me!</i>' says Duncan Matheson.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I thought that "whosoever" meant "me"</i>' says
Weaver.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I saw that "whosoever" meant "me,"</i>' says
Matheson.
</p>

<p>
'<i>The happiness I then enjoyed I cannot describe</i>,'
says our English coal-miner.
</p>

<p>
'<i>I could not contain myself for gladness</i>,' says our
Scottish stonemason.
</p>

<p>
We may dismiss the evangelists with that, and
turn to the missionaries.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Like Richard Weaver and Duncan Matheson,
Frederick Arnot and Egerton R. Young were contemporaries.
I heard them both--Fred Arnot in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Exeter Hall and Egerton Young in New Zealand.
They lived and labored on opposite sides of the
Atlantic. Fred Arnot gave himself to the fierce
Barotses of Central Africa; Egerton Young set himself
to win the Red Men of the North American
woods and prairies.
</p>

<p>
Arnot's life is one of the most pathetic romances
that even Africa has given to the world. He made
the wildest men love him. Sir Francis de Winton
declares that Arnot made the name of Englishman
fragrant amidst the vilest habitations of cruelty.
'He lived a life of great hardship,' says Sir Ralph
Williams; 'I have seen many missionaries under
varied circumstances, but such an absolutely forlorn
man, existing on from day to day, almost homeless,
without any of the appliances that make life bearable,
I have never seen.' And the secret of this great
unselfish life? The secret was the text. He was
only six when he heard Livingstone. He at once
vowed that he, too, would go to Africa. When his
friends asked how he would get there, he replied
that, if that were all, he would swim. But nobody
knew better than he did that the real obstacles that
stood between himself and a life like Livingstone's
were not physical but spiritual. He could not lead
Africa into the kingdom of Christ unless he had first
entered that kingdom himself. As a boy of ten, he
found himself lying awake at two o'clock one morning,
repeating a text. He went over it again and
again and again. <i>God so loved the world that He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</i>
'This,' says Sir William Robertson Nicoll, 'was
Arnot's lifelong creed, and he worked in its spirit.'
'This,' he says himself, 'was my first and chief
message.' He could imagine none greater.
</p>

<p>
Exactly so was it with Egerton Young. He tells
us, for example, of the way in which he invaded the
Nelson River district and opened work among people
who had never before heard the gospel. He is surrounded
by two hundred and fifty or three hundred
wild Indians. 'I read aloud,' he says, 'those sublime
words: <i>For God so loved the world that He
gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</i>
They listened with the most rapt attention whilst
for four hours I talked to them of the truths of this
glorious verse. When I had finished, every eye
turned towards the principal chief. He rose, and,
coming near me, delivered one of the most thrilling
addresses I have ever heard. Years have passed
away since that hour, and yet the memory of that
tall, straight, impassioned Indian is as vivid as ever.
His actions were many, but all were graceful. His
voice was particularly fine and full of pathos, for he
spoke from the heart.'
</p>

<p>
'"Missionary," exclaimed the stately old chief,
"I have not, for a long time, believed in our religion.
I hear God in the thunder, in the tempest and in
the storm: I see His power in the lightning that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
shivers the tree: I see His goodness in giving us the
moose, the reindeer, the beaver, and the bear. I see
His loving-kindness in sending us, when the south
winds blow, the ducks and geese; and when the snow
and ice melt away, and our lakes and rivers are open
again, I see how He fills them with fish. I have
watched all this for years, and I have felt that the
Great Spirit, so kind and watchful and loving, could
not be pleased by the beating of the conjurer's drum
or the shaking of the rattle of the medicine man.
And so I have had no religion. But what you have
just said fills my heart and satisfies its longings. I
am so glad you have come with this wonderful story.
Stay as long as you can!"'
</p>

<p>
Other chiefs followed in similar strains; and each
such statement was welcomed by the assembled
Indians with vigorous applause. The message of
the text was the very word that they had all been
waiting for.
</p>

<p>
Fred Arnot found that it was what <i>Africa</i> was
waiting for!
</p>

<p>
Egerton Young found that it was what <i>America</i>
was waiting for!
</p>

<p>
It is the word that <i>all the world</i> is waiting for!
</p>

<p>
For that text is <i>Everybody's Text</i>!
</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>
A pair of evangelists--Weaver and Matheson!
</p>

<p>
A pair of missionaries--Arnot and Young!
</p>

<p>
I have one other pair of witnesses waiting to testify
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
that this text is <i>Everybody's Text</i>. Martin
Luther and Lord Cairns have very little in common.
One was German; the other was English. One was
born in the fifteenth century; the other in the nineteenth.
One was a monk; the other was Lord
Chancellor. But they had <i>this</i> in common, that they
had to die. And when they came to die, they turned
their faces in the same direction. Lord Cairns, with
his parting breath, quietly but clearly repeated the
words of <i>Everybody's Text</i>. <i>God so loved the world
that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever
believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting
life.</i>
</p>

<p>
During his last illness, Luther was troubled with
severe headaches. Someone recommended to him
an expensive medicine. Luther smiled.
</p>

<p>
'No,' he said, 'my best prescription for head and
heart is that <i>God so loved the world that He gave
His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish but have everlasting
life</i>.'
</p>

<p>
A fortnight before he passed away, he repeated
the text with evident ecstasy, and added, 'What
Spartan saying can be compared with this wonderful
brevity? It is a Bible in itself!' And in his dying
moments he again repeated the words, thrice over, in
Latin.
</p>

<p>
'They are the best prescription for headache and
heartache!' said Luther.
</p>

<p>
There were headaches and heartaches in the world
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
three thousand years ago, when Cleopatra's Needle
stood beside the Temple at Heliopolis!
</p>

<p>
There will be headaches and heartaches in the
world centuries hence, when the obelisk is rescued
from among the ruins of London!
</p>

<p>
There were headaches and heartaches among
those Barotse tribes to whom Fred Arnot went!
</p>

<p>
There were headaches and heartaches among
those tattooed braves to whom Egerton Young carried
the message!
</p>

<p>
There are headaches and heartaches in England,
as the Lord Chancellor knew!
</p>

<p>
There are headaches and heartaches in Germany,
as Luther found!
</p>

<p>
And, because there are headaches and heartaches
for everybody, this is <i>Everybody's Text</i>. There is,
as Luther said, nothing like it.
</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>
When Sir Harry Lauder was here in Melbourne,
he had just sustained the loss of his only son. His
boy had fallen at the front. And, with this in mind,
Sir Harry told a beautiful and touching story. 'A
man came to my dressing-room in a New York
theater,' he said, 'and told of an experience that had
recently befallen him. In American towns, any
household that had given a son to the war was entitled
to place a star on the window-pane. Well, a
few nights before he came to see me, this man was
walking down a certain avenue in New York accompanied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
by his wee boy. The lad became very interested
in the lighted windows of the houses, and
clapped his hands when he saw the star. As they
passed house after house, he would say, "Oh, look,
Daddy, there's another house that has given a son
to the war! And there's another! There's one with
two stars! And look! there's a house with no star
at all!" At last they came to a break in the houses.
Through the gap could be seen the evening star shining
brightly in the sky. The little fellow caught his
breath. "Oh, look, Daddy," he cried, "God must
have given <i>His</i> Son, for He has got a star in <i>His</i>
window."'
</p>

<p>
'He has, indeed!' said Sir Harry Lauder, in repeating
the story.
</p>

<p>
But it took the clear eyes of a little child to discover
that the very stars are repeating <i>Everybody's
Text</i>. The heavens themselves are telling of the
love that gave a Saviour to die for the sins of the
world.
